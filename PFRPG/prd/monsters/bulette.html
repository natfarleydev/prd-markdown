				<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Special Abilities</b></p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Leap (Ex)</b> A bulette can perform a special kind of pounce attack by jumping into combat. When a bulette charges, it can make a DC 20 <a href="../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it makes the <a href="../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check, it can follow up with four claw attacks against foes in reach, but cannot make a bite attack.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Savage Bite (Ex)</b> A bulette's bite is particularly dangerous. It applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage inflicted with its bite attack, and threatens a critical hit on a 19&ndash;20.</p>
				<p>The creation of some unknown arcanist in millennia past, the bulette has bred true to become one of the fiercest predators of the hills. Burrowing rapidly through the earth just beneath the surface, sometimes with its armored fin cutting a distinctive wake behind it, the bulette launches itself free of stone and soil to tear into its prey without remorse, giving rise to the common appellation “landshark.”</p>
				<p>Bulettes are notoriously foul-tempered, attacking far larger creatures with no regard for personal safety. Solitary beasts except for the occasional mated pair, they spend most of their time patrolling the perimeters of territories that can stretch up to 30 square miles, hunting game and punishing interlopers with a fury that shakes the hillsides.</p>
				<p>Bulettes are perfect eating machines, consuming bones, armor, and even magical items with their powerful jaws and churning stomach acid. Lacking other food, the bulette might gnaw on inanimate objects, yet for unknown reasons no bulette voluntarily consumes elf flesh&mdash;a peccadillo many point to as evidence that elven wizardry was involved in its creation. Dwarves are also rarely eaten by the beasts, though the bulette still slaughters members of either race on sight. Halflings, on the other hand, are among the beast's favorite meals, and no halfling with any sense ventures into bulette country casually.</p>
				<p>The bulette is a cunning fighter, surprising foes with its impressive agility. One of its favorite tactics is to charge forward and launch itself into the air in order to drop on its prey with all four razor-sharp claws extended. Folklore claims that the flesh behind the beast's dorsal crest is particularly tender, and that those willing and able to wait until the fin is raised in the excitement of combat or mating can target it for a killing blow&mdash;yet most who have faced the landshark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it entirely.</p>
