				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> transmutation: <b>Level</b> druid 2, ranger 2</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> 30 ft.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Area</b> 30-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you</p>

				<p>You call on the plants nearby to aid you in combat. This spell is ineffective if no plants you can direct are within the area. You can spend a swift action and/or a standard action on each of your turns to direct one of the following attacks. The attack bonus or CMB for these attacks equals your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier. You grant a +1 bonus per three caster levels (maximum +5) on damage rolls due to this spell. Your <i><a href="#wilderness-soldiers" >wilderness soldiers</a></i> never provoke attacks of opportunity, and they do not count as allies for flanking or other purposes.</p>
				<p id="tree" class="stat-block-2"><i>Tree</i>: A tree makes a melee attack with a 10-foot reach from its trunk. A hit deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 points + your Wisdom modifier. The tree can instead attempt a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver with the same reach, but the tree cannot move itself.</p><br>
				<p id="undergrowth-or-hedgerow" class="stat-block-2"><i>Undergrowth or Hedgerow</i>: Acting as a Medium creature, one square of undergrowth or hedgerow attempts a grapple combat maneuver against an opponent within or adjacent to that square. Heavy undergrowth gains a +2 bonus to its CMD. Undergrowth cannot move the grapple or pin a foe, but it can deal an amount of damage equal to 1d4 points + your Wisdom modifier by making a successful grapple check against a foe it is grappling. The undergrowth's CMD is 5 + its CMB. If you fail to direct the undergrowth to maintain the grapple, it releases its opponent.</p>
