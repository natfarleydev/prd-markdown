				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> illusion (pattern) [light, mind-affecting]; <b>Level</b> bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (a sprinkle of flash powder)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> one living creature and special; see text</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; see text; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes</p>
				<p>You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines the target and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any concealment for the target. The target must make a successful Will save. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will save, the <i><a href="#wandering-star-motes" >wandering star motes</a></i> jump to the nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the <i><a href="#wandering-star-motes" >wandering star motes</a></i> jump to the next nearest enemy within 30 feet. A given creature can only be affected by the <i><a href="#wandering-star-motes" >wandering star motes</a></i> once; once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures; your allies are not affected.</p>
