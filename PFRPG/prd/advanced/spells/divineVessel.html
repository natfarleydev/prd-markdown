				<p id="divine-vessel" class="stat-block-title"><b>Divine Vessel</b></p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> transmutation [chaotic, evil, good, or lawful]; <b>Level</b> oracle 8</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> personal</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> you</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>
				<p>You accept otherworldly energies into your body and transform. Your size increases by one category, your height doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. Your features shift into those of a cold and alien being of logic, a creature of primal chaos, an angelic presence, or a fiendish monster, as chosen by you. You gain a +6 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3 natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 ft., and SR of 12 + your caster level. These modifiers replace the normal modifiers for increasing your size. The size modifier for AC, attacks, CMB, and CMD changes as appropriate for your new size category. This spell doesn't change your base speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate for your new size.</p>
				<p>If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you&mdash;the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.</p>
				<p>All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by this spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.</p>
				<p>You gain additional abilities as noted below.</p>
				<p id="anarchic-aspect"><b>Anarchic aspect</b>: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Constitution, DR 10/lawful, resist acid 10, electricity 10, and sonic 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, blindsense 30 feet, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain a bite attack dealing 2d6 points of damage. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
				<p id="axiomatic-aspect"><b>Axiomatic aspect</b>: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Strength, DR 10/chaotic, resist cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
				<p id="celestial-aspect"><b>Celestial aspect</b>: You gain the following abilities: a +2 bonus to Dexterity, DR 10/evil, resist acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
				<p id="fiendish-aspect"><b>Fiendish aspect</b>: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Strength, DR 10/good, resist acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, see in darkness, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 claw attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
				<p>When used to assume an anarchic, axiomatic, celestial, or fiendish aspect, this spell is a chaotic, lawful, good, or evil spell respectively.</p>
