				<p>This spell creates a vertical <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a>'s</i> maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i>, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack). </p>
				<p>A creature can move through a <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check&mdash;failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> also radiates heat as if it were a <i><a href="../../spells/wallOfFire.html#_wall-of-fire" >wall of fire</a></i>, although the heat from a <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> radiates from both sides.</p>
				<p>Once per round as a move action, you can direct the <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall's overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.</p>
				<p>All damage inflicted by physical contact with a <i><a href="#wall-of-lava" >wall of lava</a></i> continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p>
