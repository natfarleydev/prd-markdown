				<p><i>Freezing sphere </i>creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is <a href="../glossary.html#_staggered" >staggered</a> for 1d4 rounds.</p>
				<p>If the <i>freezing sphere </i>strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 <a href="../gettingStarted.html#_strength" >Strength</a> check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.</p>
				<p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the <i>freezing sphere </i>bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.</p>
