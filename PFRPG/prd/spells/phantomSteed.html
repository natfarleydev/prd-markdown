				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> conjuration (creation); <b>Level</b> bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 10 minutes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> 0 ft.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> one quasi-real, horselike creature</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 hour/level (D)</p>

				<p>You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.</p>
				<p>The mount is <a href="../combat.html#_armor-class" >AC</a> 18 (&ndash;1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 <a href="../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity" >Dex</a>) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.</p>
				<p>These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels. </p>
				<p><i>8th Level</i>: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.</p>
				<p><i>10th Level</i>: The mount can use <i><a href="waterWalk.html#_water-walk" >water walk</a> </i>at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).</p>
				<p><i>12th Level</i>: The mount can use <i><a href="airWalk.html#_air-walk" >air walk</a> </i>at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.</p>
				<p><i>14th Level</i>: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.</p>
