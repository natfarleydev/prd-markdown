				<p id="contingency" class="stat-block-title"><b>Contingency</b></p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> evocation; <b>Level</b> sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> at least 10 minutes; see text</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a spell-using creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> personal</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> you</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 day/level (D) or until discharged</p>
				<p>You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting <i>contingency</i>. The <i>contingency </i>spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast <i>contingency.</i></p>
				<p>The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency </i>must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</p>
				<p>The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <i>contingency </i>immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>contingency </i>and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.</p>
				<p>You can use only one <i>contingency </i>spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.</p>
