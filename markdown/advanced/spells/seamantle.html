				<p id="seamantle" class="stat-block-title"><b>Seamantle</b></p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> conjuration (creation) [water]; <b>Level</b> druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (a cup of water)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> personal </p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> you</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 minute/level</p>
				<p>You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the <i><a href="#seamantle" >seamantle</a></i>, but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have <i><a href="../../spells/freedomOfMovement.html#_freedom-of-movement" >freedom of movement</a></i> effects. The cover granted by the <i><a href="#seamantle" >seamantle</a></i> does not enable you to make <a href="../../skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as <i><a href="../../spells/cloudkill.html#_cloudkill" >cloudkill</a></i>).</p>
				<p>The <i><a href="#seamantle" >seamantle</a></i> blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the <i><a href="#seamantle" >seamantle</a></i>; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes effect as a bubble of steam contained within the <i><a href="#seamantle" >seamantle</a></i> rather than its usual effect.</p>
				<p>The <i><a href="#seamantle" >seamantle</a></i> allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as <i><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic" >dispel magic</a></i>; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as <i><a href="../../spells/flameBlade.html#_flame-blade" >flame blade</a></i>, <i><a href="../../spells/flamingSphere.html#_flaming-sphere" >flaming sphere</a></i>, or <i><a href="../../spells/incendiaryCloud.html#_incendiary-cloud" >incendiary cloud</a></i>). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A <i><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming" >flaming</a></i> or <i><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming-burst" >flaming burst</a></i> weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.</p>
