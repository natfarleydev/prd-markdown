				<p>This spell functions as <i><a href="createPit.html#_create-pit-" >create pit</a></i>, except that it places a 5-foot-deep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed. Refer to Table 9&ndash;2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 216). Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb" >Climb</a> DC of 30.</p>
