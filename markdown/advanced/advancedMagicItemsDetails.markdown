  : Table: Armor Special Abilities

A shield or suit of armor with a special ability must have at least a +1
enhancement bonus.

**Champion**: This armor property only works for good creatures with the
challenge ability (such as cavaliers) or the smite evil ability (such as
paladins, half-celestials, and creatures with the celestial creature
template). When worn by such a creature that uses a challenge or smite
ability, the wearer gains a +2 sacred bonus to AC against attacks from
the chosen opponent.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[protection from
evil](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*
or *[protection from
good](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/protectionFromGood.html#_protection-from-good)*;
Price +1 bonus.

**Dastard**: This armor property only works for evil creatures with the
challenge ability (such as cavaliers) or the smite good ability (such as
antipaladins, half-fiends, and creatures with the fiendish creature
template). When worn by such a creature that uses a challenge or smite
ability, the wearer gains a +2 profane bonus to AC against attacks from
the chosen opponent.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[protection from
evil](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*
or *[protection from
good](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/protectionFromGood.html#_protection-from-good)*;
Price +1 bonus.

**Determination**: A shield or armor with this property provides the
ability to fight on against seemingly impossible odds. Once per day,
when the owner reaches 0 or fewer hit points, the item automatically
provides a *[breath of
life](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/breathOfLife.html#_breath-of-life)*
spell.

Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[breath of
life](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/breathOfLife.html#_breath-of-life)*;
Price +30,000 gp.

**Jousting**: This suit of armor helps its wearer remain mounted and in
control of his mount. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on
[Ride](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/ride.html#_ride) skill checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
creator must have 5 ranks in the
[Ride](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/ride.html#_ride) skill; Price +3,750
gp.

**Righteous**: Armor with this property is often engraved or enameled
with religious symbols. On command once per day, the wearer can invoke
an effect, as per the spell *[righteous
might](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/righteousMight.html#_righteous-might)*,
lasting for 10 rounds. Righteous armor is always aligned toward good
(positive energy), for the effects of *[righteous
might](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/righteousMight.html#_righteous-might)*.
*[Righteous]* armor bestows one permanent negative level on
any evil creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as
long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This
negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by
*[restoration](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/restoration.html#_restoration)*
spells) while the armor is worn.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[righteous
might](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/righteousMight.html#_righteous-might)*;
Cost +27,000 gp.

**Unrighteous**: This armor is often sculpted with unholy symbols. On
command once per day, the wearer can invoke an effect, as per the spell
*[righteous
might](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/righteousMight.html#_righteous-might)*,
lasting for 10 rounds. *[Unrighteous]* armor is always
aligned toward evil (negative energy), for the effects of *[righteous
might](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/righteousMight.html#_righteous-might)*.
Unrighteous armor bestows one permanent negative level on any good
creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as long as
the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative level
cannot be overcome in any way (including by
*[restoration](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/restoration.html#_restoration)*
spells) while the armor is worn.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[righteous
might](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/righteousMight.html#_righteous-might)*;
Cost +27,000 gp.

Table: Specific Armors



**Armor Of Insults**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 16,175 gp; **Weight** 20 lbs.

**Description**

Each metal bit of this suit of *+1 studded leather* looks more like a
tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per day the wearer of the
armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse
directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and
hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw
to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for
the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its
next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk
(moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it
can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and
has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken language.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[confusion](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/confusion.html#_confusion)*;

**Boneless Leather**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** armor; **Price** 12,160 gp; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This suit of *+1 leather* gives its wearer the ability to twist and
contort his body in virtually any direction. He gains a +5 bonus on
[Escape
Artist](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist)
checks, a +5 bonus on
[Acrobatics](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics)
checks to reduce damage from falls, a +5 bonus to CMD, and DR 5/piercing
or slashing.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[alter self](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/alterSelf.html#_alter-self)*,

[Escape
Artist](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist)
skills; **Cost** 6,160 gp

**Buccaneer's Breastplate**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 23,850 gp; **Weight** 30 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 breastplate* is made of bluish metal and decorated with wave
motifs. It allows the wearer to continually utilize the effects of the
spell *[water
walk](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/waterWalk.html#_water-walk)*. If a
creature puts on the armor while underwater, the wearer is borne toward
the surface at a rate of 60 feet per round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[water walk](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/waterWalk.html#_water-walk)*;
**Cost** 12,100 gp

**Daystar Half-Plate**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 81,250 gp; **Weight** 50 lbs.

**Description**

The silvery sheen of this *+1 half-plate* causes it to sparkle in even
the faintest light. At will, the wearer can command it to shine with a
*[daylight](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/daylight.html#_daylight)* spell
for 10 minutes. Once per day, the wearer can command it to shine as per
the *[sunburst](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/sunburst.html#_sunburst)*
spell.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[daylight](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/daylight.html#_daylight)*,
*[sunburst](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/sunburst.html#_sunburst)*;
**Cost** 41,000 gp

**Folding Plate**

**Aura** moderate conjuration (summoning); **CL** 10th

**Slot** neck (brooch) or armor (unfolded); **Price** 12,650 gp;
**Weight** — (brooch), 50 lbs. (armor)

**Description**

This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often
depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command, the brooch
transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover
the wearer in a complete suit of *+1 full plate*, with the design of the
brooch displayed on the armor's breastplate. The same command word
causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only
transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work
if the wearer is already armored.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[instant
summons](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/instantSummons.html#_instant-summons)*;
**Cost** 7,650 gp

**Forsaken Banded Mail**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 25,400 gp; **Weight** 35 lbs.

**Description**

Every inch of this suit of *+1 banded mail* bears a defaced holy symbol
or a design equally offensive to one or more gods and their servants.
The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine spells or use any spell-like
supernatural ability gained from a connection to a deity. The wearer
gains SR 19 against any divine-origin spell, spell-like ability, or
supernatural ability (such as a domain granted power or ability from an
outsider serving a deity), and treats the armor's enhancement bonus as
+2 higher against creatures with these abilities.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
creator cannot be a divine spellcaster; **Cost** 12,900 gp

**Giant-Hide Armor**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 39,165 gp (ogre), 46,665 gp (hill giant),
59,165 gp (troll), 54,165 gp (stone, fire, or frost giant), 69,165 gp
(cloud giant), 76,665 gp (storm giant); **Weight** 25 lbs.

**Description**

This drooping, many-folded suit of *+3 hide armor* is made from the
tanned skin of an actual giant. Once per day on command, the wearer can
grow to match the size of the appropriate giant, as if using *[giant
form I](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/giantForm.html#_giant-form-i)* (ogre,
troll, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, or frost giant) or *[giant
form II](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/giantForm.html#_giant-form-ii)*
(cloud giant or storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15
minutes, and ends when the wearer commands. Most good folk consider
wearing the skins of intelligent creatures to be abhorrent. Giants gain
a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the wearer, or +4
if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as the
attacker.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[giant form I](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/giantForm.html#_giant-form-i)*
(ogre, troll, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, or frost giant) or
*[giant form
II](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/giantForm.html#_giant-form-ii)* (cloud
giant or storm giant); **Cost** 19,660 gp (ogre), 23,415 gp (hill
giant), 29,665 gp (troll), 27,165 gp (stone, fire, or frost giant),
34,665 gp (cloud giant), 38,415 gp (storm giant)

**Mistmail**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** armor; **Price** 2,250 gp; **Weight** 25 lbs.

**Description**

The fine links of this *+1 chain shirt* form a pattern of roiling
clouds. On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into thick
fog that fills his space and provides concealment (20% miss chance).
This mist moves with the character. Effects that disperse the mist or
destroy it cause the armor to reform into its solid shape on the
character's body, as does speaking the command word or entering a place
where the fog-magic doesn't function (such as underwater). If the
character tries to don another suit of armor while the *mistmail*is in
fog form, it reforms at the character's feet.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[obscuring
mist](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/obscuringMist.html#_obscuring-mist)*;
**Cost** 1,250 gp

**Murderer's Blackcloth**

**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 12,405 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

**Description**

This silk *+1
[shadow](/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-shadow) padded
armor* is as dark as night and stitched with thread the color of dried
blood. When worn by a rogue with the bleed talent, it increases the
bleed damage of the rogue's sneak attacks by +1.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[bleed](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/bleed.html#_bleed)*,
*[invisibility](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility)*,
*[silence](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/silence.html#_silence)*; **Cost**
6,280 gp

**Soothsayer's Raiment**

**Aura** faint divination; **CL** 5th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 10,300 gp; **Weight** 40 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 chainmail* is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and
contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class
description). While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that
revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature.
The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for
example, a *soothsayer's raiment (battlecry)* is only usable by an
oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the
revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the
oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability
has no effect if worn by a non-oracle.

For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as
*[augury](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/augury.html#_augury)* and
*[divination](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/divination.html#_divination)*),
the wearer's chance increases by +5.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[augury](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/augury.html#_augury)*, creator must
be an oracle with the desired revelation; **Cost** 5,300 gp

  : Table: Specific Shields

**Battlement Shield**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** shield; **Price** 16,180 gp; **Weight** 45 lbs.

**Description**

Once per day on command, this *+2 tower
[shield](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield)* can transform
into a solid, 10-foot by 10-foot by 1-foot wall of masonry with a
battlement on top and an arrow slit in each 5-foot length. The wall acts
as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can touch the wall
with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting
on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in
the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other
foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC of 35).
Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform
back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken
condition. The shield remains in wall form until destroyed or commanded
to return to shield form. The wall cannot appear in a space too small to
accommodate it.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor),
*[wall of
stone](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/wallOfStone.html#_wall-of-stone)*;
**Cost** 8,180 gp

**Fortress Shield**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 11th

**Slot** shield; **Price** 19,180 gp; **Weight** 45 lbs.

**Description**

The wearer of this *+1 tower
[shield](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield)* may, as a
full-round action, transform the shield into a 1-inch thick cube of iron
that springs into being around him, completely enclosing his space. The
cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per side. This cube grants the
wearer total cover against everything outside the cube, including (as it
is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas attacks. The inside of the cube is
dark, and air cannot get in or out so the wearer must hold his breath
starting on the third round after activating the cube. Attacks
sufficient to destroy one side of the cube cause it to immediately
transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains
the broken condition. Otherwise, the cube reverts to shield form upon
command, if the wearer moves from his current space, or the wearer falls
unconscious or dies.

Cursed Items

# Cursed Items

The following are additional cursed items that may arise from faulty
item crafting—or in some cases, deliberate construction. Many cannot be
discarded unless a successful *[remove
curse]*, *[break
enchantment]*, or
similar magic is used on them.

**Buffoon's Sword**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This blade seems and behaves in all ways as a *[sword of
subtlety]* until
actually used in combat. Once used in combat, it imposes a -10 penalty
on all [Stealth] checks made by its
wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for the owner to tell a lie
or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time he does so, he must
make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid blurting out the truth or taking
some other involuntary action that spoils his attempted ruse. Only
curse-ending magic can rid the wielder of the sword once its curse
activates.

**Magic Items** *[sword of
subtlety]*

**Cannibal Ring**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 16th

**Slot** ring; **Weight** —

**Description**

This simple and unadorned copper ring appears slightly tarnished, but
seemingly wards off the effects of hunger or other sorts of deprivation;
all tests reveal it to be a *[ring of
sustenance]*. However,
after wearing it for 7 days, its owner instead comes to suffer from
almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if not sated, ultimately
drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must eat and
drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a
starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage
instead of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to
experience ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent
creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher).

Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal
damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer
lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he
is in a situation in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he
must make a DC 15 Will save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer
succumbs to this urge again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed
starvation and thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to
avoiding the increased hunger and thirst—on any day he eats at least one
meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to make
hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage
from failing these checks. Once its curse activates, the ring cannot be
removed until the curse is broken.

sustenance]*

**Cloak of Immolation**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** shoulders; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This cloak appears to be a finely made normal garment that radiates
protective magic. The cloak can be handled or examined without harm, but
when it is put on, it immediately bursts into flames that burn
continuously but do not harm the cloak, only its wearer. The cloak deals
1d6 points of fire damage each round and cannot be removed unless the
curse is broken. Sufficient amounts of water or other smothering
materials can douse the flames temporarily, but the cloak reignites when
exposed to air again. Spells like *[resist
energy]*, *[protection
from
energy]*,
and similar effects can protect the wearer against the cloak's flames
while they last.

**Magic Items** any cloak

**Crown of Blindness**

**Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 10th

**Slot** headband; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky moonstone. When a
wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly goes dark like the
waning moon, and the wearer must make a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or
immediately go blind. The saving throw must be made each round that the
crown is worn until the wearer succumbs to the blindness. Removing the
circlet requires breaking the curse. The blindness can be cured using
*[remove
blindness/deafness]*
or any spell normally used to end a curse.

**Gravesoul Armor**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** armor; **Weight** 20 lbs.

**Description**

This armor behaves in all ways as if it were *+1 [undead
controlling]
studded leather* until its owner actually attempts to use its special
property. At that point, the wearer and all living creatures within a
20-foot radius must each make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid
believing that they are actually some sort of undead creature for the
next 24 hours. The GM can either roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5
ghouls, 6 vampire) or choose which sorts of undead the affected
creatures believe themselves to be, customizing to the personality and
abilities of each creature. Creatures affected by the armor behave as
normal for the sorts of undead they regard themselves—“zombies”
mindlessly attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to
bite victims on the neck, and so on—but gain none of the special
abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react negatively to
effects that harm “their” type of undead, so “vampires” avoid garlic,
“wraiths” recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures otherwise
continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to
the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires
using abilities they have but “their” type of undead normally lacks; for
example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel
energy and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures
affected by *gravesoul armor*.

This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of the
armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it can only
work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour period. Regardless of
the curse, the armor is still *+1 studded leather*, and some characters
may find it useful despite its (nonexistent) power over undead. Unlike
most cursed items, this one is easily discarded without any magical
assistance.

**Magic Items** *+1 [undead

**Hat of Hatreds**

**Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 10th

**Slot** head; **Weight** —

**Description**

This hat performs in all ways like a *[hat of
disguise]* until
its owner attempts to use it to disguise himself in the presence of a
hostile creature. Once he does, the hat causes him to assume the guise
of the creature or person the hostile creature most wants to harm. The
hat never causes the wearer to assume the appearance of someone the
viewer wouldn't harm if he had the opportunity (for example, the greatly
feared leader of the local temple).

Once the hat reveals its true abilities, it no longer responds to
attempts by its wearer to change his appearance. Instead, it
automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to and
despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary illusions
that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or weak. For example,
in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like the tribe's chief, but
sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town, the wearer may look like the
hated local bully, drunk and staggering. In an evil town, the wearer
looks like a confused visitor and appears to be an ideal target to
victimize with some crime.

Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.

**Girdle of Opposite Gender**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** belt; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

When this magical belt is put on, the wearer must immediately make a DC
20 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a person of the
opposite gender. The character's abilities, mind, and spirit remain
unaffected; only the character's sex changes. If the character's saving
throw is a natural 1, the item actually removes all gender from the
wearer, giving him an androgynous, neutered appearance. The change is
permanent unless undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic takes
effect, the belt can be removed without effort. A creature can only be
affected by a particular girdle once, though other girdles of this type
can cause another transformation.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** any belt

**Planar Invasion Shield**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th

**Slot** shield; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This impressive shield seems to be and behaves in all ways as an
*[absorbing shield]*
until its owner attempts to use its disintegration power in combat. Once
he does, it instead causes one or more monsters to pour forth from the
shield and attack the nearest creature each round (including the
shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating from the battle by the
safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the
monsters fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the
monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the summon monster spell
and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that appear. Monsters
conjured by this shield remain until killed, act as normal for their
kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with a permanent duration.

Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three times
per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge
directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried
or underwater), they instead appear at the nearest safe location within
50 feet. Successful curse-breaking magic cast on the shield restores it
to its previous guise as an *[absorbing
shield]* and allows its
wearer to abandon it.

**One-Way Window**

**Aura** faint divination; **CL**5th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 1 lb. (20 lbs. in larger form)

**Description**

This small, 6-inch-square glass tablet grows to a 6-foot-by-3-foot
window if placed on any sufficiently large vertical surface and returns
to its original size if removed. The window melds ever so slightly into
the surface, allowing it to ignore minor protrusions, curves, or
anything else that would normally make it difficult to simply lay down a
pane of glass. On command, the front of this glass displays all
activities on the other side of this surface like a window, piercing
wood, earth, or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal. The window does
not reveal its existence to non-hostile creatures depicted within it,
allowing observers to study them at their leisure.

However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile
creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window presents
its owner and anyone looking through the window with an artificial image
of the other side designed to lull them into a sense of false
confidence—enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank
bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While presenting this image to
those in front of the mirror, it reveals those viewers to the enemies
being observed, creating a two-way window; however, viewed creatures see
those using the mirror accurately and can read their thoughts as if
using *[detect
thoughts]*.
Furthermore, the image shown to those using the mirror does not reveal
that the creatures they are watching can see them as well. Once the
curse activates, the owner comes to regard using the mirror to spy ahead
as his most effective tactic (after all, it has no limit to its
duration) and does so whenever possible until curse-breaking magic frees
him from its influence (anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles,
even if he wasn't the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to
this desire to continue using it).

**Creation**

**Requirements** *[mirror of life
trapping]*,
*[mirror of
opposition]*

**Ring of Truth**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 9th

**Slot** ring; **Weight** —

**Description**

Deceptively pleasant looking, a *ring of truth* bears images of
childlike angels and broadly smiling divine creatures holding onto links
of a heavy chain. The wearer of this cursed ring is rendered unable to
tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or writing. The wearer may
simply omit the truth or choose not to communicate, but even then must
succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw to avoid answering a direct
question truthfully. The wearer cannot remove the ring unless the magic
of the curse is negated.

**Riot Pipes**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This simple musical instrument seems and behaves in all ways like any
other kind of magical pipes until its owner plays it in an urban
setting. Once he does, it requires all people within hearing to make a
DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid falling into a murderous fury. Those
who fail their saves gain the effects of a
*[rage]* spell for the next 1d6 hours and
experience a strong compulsion (Will DC 15 negates) to attack any
stranger or disliked person whom they encounter during this time. If the
owner spends more than 3 consecutive days in an urban setting, he must
make a DC 15 Will saving throw each day to avoid playing the *riot
pipes* at some point during each subsequent day. The pipes remain with
the player until the curse is broken.

**Magic Items** *[pipes of
haunting]*,

**Rod of Arson**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

All tests indicate that this hollow metal tube is a *[rod of flame
extinguishing]*
until its owner uses it to extinguish or suppress a fire in a combat or
other sort of dangerous situation. Once he does, he discovers that
rather than quenching the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter his
body. This flame persists inside of him for the next 24 hours, causing
minor discomfort and giving him the sickened condition, but causing no
visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a
flammable object or structure, he feels inclined to set the object
ablaze, using whatever means at his disposal. Each round the wielder
resists this urge, he takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame
within him surges and roils. After 1 minute of this, he must make a DC
15 Will save or succumb to the temptation; if he saves, the urge passes,
the internal fire stops harming him, and he can interact normally with
the flammable target thereafter.

Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will saving
throw to avoid using it to extinguish or suppress any fire he encounters
which he himself did not start. He cannot use the rod against fires that
he personally started. Successful curse-breaking magic allows the
wielder to get rid of the rod and harmlessly dissipates any fire
persisting inside him from the action of the rod.

Major Artifacts

# Major Artifacts

Major artifacts are unique items—only one of each such item exists, and
the creation of them is beyond all mortal means.

**Bottle of the Bound**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The *Bottle of the Bound* is an ancient brass bottle with a narrow neck
and a rounded belly, slightly flattened on the bottom so it stands
upright when resting on a table. The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is
engraved with sigils of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a
wizard of tremendous power and wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and
trapped it within the bottle for all time. The Legion of the Bound may
be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as
they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since
buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its
inhabitants still bound.

A would-be wielder of the *Bottle of the Bound* must know three secret
commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can
be removed; the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens;
and the Word of Banishment, to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A
holder who knows the words may use the bottle like a *[summon monster
IX]* spell at will,
except only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned
creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new creatures
can be summoned from the bottle until the initial summoned creatures'
destruction or return.

No known force can open the bottle without the Word of Opening. If the
bottle is opened without the use of the Word of Binding, its 666
inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level creatures
and moving on to higher-level ones, until they all escape. If one of the
Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of Banishment being
uttered, it is free after it performs the task for which it was
summoned. The Words to use the *Bottle of the Bound* have been lost for
uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least one or
two of them.

**Destruction**

The *Bottle of the Bound* can only be destroyed if every creature bound
within is slain or banished, and the empty container is then smashed
with a *[holy]* weapon.

**Cloud Castle Of The Storm King**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King,
this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its
master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters,
ignorant of—or unable to tap into—its fantastic power.

This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a
foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and
crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the
castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each
corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more
than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls,
living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically
replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for
arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and
barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that
can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even
terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a
population of 300 Medium creatures.

Though created by the legendary Storm King millennia ago, the cloud
castle has had several masters since he mysteriously disappeared over a
thousand years ago. Many believe the Storm King ascended to godhood,
while others believe he was captured and imprisoned by a rival, a demon
lord, or even a deity wishing to remove a threat, which may mean that
the Storm King will one day return to reclaim his castle.

In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at
least 17th level, and must have the
[Leadership] feat and 17 ranks in
[Knowledge] (arcana). If the
castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another
can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a
control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th
floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device
for the castle's master, though it can only view places inside the
castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates)
can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly
speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the
[Fly] skill modifier of the person
controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a
[Fly] check and never risks falling due to a
failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly,
sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same
course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other
hazards. It has been known to travel to other planes, though no master
other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The
master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities:

*• [Call lightning
storm]*
1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to
use this ability.

-   *[Guards and
    wards]* 1/day on
    the central tower.
-   *[Storm of
    vengeance]*
    1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this
    ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon
    everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).
-   *[Wind wall]* at will. This
    effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can
    be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she
    designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.

**Destruction**

The *Cloud Castle of the Storm King* can only be destroyed if it is
dissipated by suitably strong winds; the only winds that can dissipate
it are found only in the most turbulent reaches of the Plane of Air (of
course, as nobody knows how to make it travel between planes, those
wishing to destroy it must find it on the Plane of Air to have any
chance to do so). Any other attacks may cause walls to collapse or even
side towers to break loose, but the central chamber and the floors
beneath it will continue to exist in a ruined form over a smaller storm
cloud as long as this destruction condition is not met.

**Fork of the Forgotten One**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 12 lbs.

**Description**

This *+5 [flaming]
[wounding]
[unholy] ranseur* was once the
weapon of a powerful archdevil who they say controlled an entire layer
of Hell. When he attempted to defy the Prince of Darkness, he was
overthrown and banished into some cold and remote prison at the edge of
the multiverse. Still bearing some infernal vestige of the forgotten
fiend's power, the fork grants the bearer a +10 bonus on
[Diplomacy] and
[Intimidate] checks and the
power to use *[scorching
ray]* three times per
day.

Any nonevil creature who touches the *Fork of the Forgotten One* is
given a choice: become lawful evil immediately, or die. Those who choose
death are instantly slain (Fortitude DC 30 negates). Those who choose to
become lawful evil change alignment immediately (no saving throw) and
are subject to a *[demand]* spell
(Will DC 25) requiring that they find the Forgotten One and free him
from his icy prison—presumably thereafter he will press them into
service for his plans of revenge against those who imprisoned him.

**Destruction**

The *Fork of the Forgotten One* is destroyed when a paladin of 19th
level or higher touches it and chooses death rather than becoming lawful
evil. This sacrifice still kills the paladin, though she can be raised
from the dead.

**The Moaning Diamond**

**Aura** overwhelming transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The *Moaning Diamond* appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human
fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning, as if wailing in
pain. Despite the disturbing noise, the *Moaning Diamond* is not evil.
Three times per day, the bearer can call upon its power to reshape earth
and stone as if by the spell *[stone
shape]*, affecting 5,000
cubic feet of material. Once per day the *Moaning Diamond* can also
summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the
caster until it is slain; only one such elemental can be summoned at a
time.

**Destruction**

The *Moaning Diamond* can be smashed by the combined power of three
elemental princes, one each from the Planes of Air, Fire, and Water.
Even then, the dust must be cast into a place where it will never fall
upon stone.

**The Shield of the Sun**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This *+5 large [shield]*, emblazoned
with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she
were a 20th-level paladin with a Charisma of 20. The spells gained are
cumulative with any existing spells per day the character might have,
even from paladin class levels. The
*[Shield] of the Sun* also grants its
wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage
from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In
return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a
quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid).

A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the
*[Shield] of the Sun*. The negative
levels persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome
in any way (including
*[restoration]* spells). The
negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the
wearer's possession.

**Destruction**

The *[Shield] of the Sun* may be
destroyed if a good-aligned character casts it into the Well of Eternal
Night, its light fading into the inky depths before it finally
disappears. If a nongood character does the deed, the shield is not
destroyed, merely lost, and a quest to the Plane of Shadow may recover
it.

Minor Artifacts

# Minor Artifacts

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are
magic items that can no longer be created, at least by common mortal
means.

**Beacon of True Faith**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

The *beacon of true faith* takes the form of an ornate torch made of
electrum. The torch holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel
or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an
everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with
an alignment subtype, or a creature of especially strong religious faith
(GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this
devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's
alignment. All of these are command-word activated.

Chaotic (violet flame): *[Word of
chaos]* once per day on
command.

Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the
benefits of *[protection from
evil]* and
*[heroism]*.

Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of
*[protection from
good]* and
may use *[harm]* twice per day.

Lawful (golden flame): *[Dictum]* once
per day on command.

**Destruction**

The *beacon of true faith* is destroyed if its bearer turns against the
worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite alignment.

**Hammer of Thunderbolts**

**Aura** strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This *+3 Large
[returning] warhammer*
deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. In the hands of a
wielder who wears a *[belt of giant
strength]*
and knows the weapon is a *hammer of thunderbolts* (not just the *+3
warhammer* it appears to be), it becomes a *+5 Large giant-bane
[returning]
[thundering] warhammer* with
the following two properties. One, when the bearer hits with the hammer
as a thrown attack, it emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all
creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude
negates); the wielder is not immune to this effect. Two, the hammer's
range increment increases to 30 feet.

**Destruction**

A *hammer of thunderbolts* is destroyed if heated in a fire giant's
forge and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned humanoid, which causes
the iron of the *hammer* to become so brittle it shatters the next time
it is used to strike. Only bathing it in a fire giant's blood can
reverse its brittleness; once shattered, nothing can do so.

**Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of
bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the
*knucklebone's* true power and nature becomes apparent. When a creature
holding the *knucklebone of fickle fortune* looks upon it, he sees that
the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side
bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die,
instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at
the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect,
based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to
determine the effect (see Table 7-13). For effects that are lost if the
die is rolled again (such as \#17) or a specific result is rolled (such
as \#14), the character is aware of this restriction.

  d20   Rune Name   Effect
  ----- ----------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1     Eya-Doh     The character gains 1 permanent negative level.
  2     Bvu         The character is subject to a powerful compulsion never to roll the *[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* again. He can shake this compulsion only by succeeding a DC 25 Will saving throw. He can only attempt this saving throw once a day.
  3     Eij         The character is affected by a *[harm]* spell (caster level 15th).
  4     Hor         The character is subject to a powerful compulsion to roll the *knucklebone* three more times immediately (Will DC 25 negates). All three of these rolls are made with a -5 penalty on the *knucklebone's* die roll (minimum 1).
  5     Veh         The character is blinded as with *[blindness/deafness]* (no saving throw).
  6     Chu         The character takes 5d10 points of cold damage (DC 25 Fort save for half) and moves at half speed for the next hour (a successful saving throw does not negate the reduced speed).
  7     Roh         For the next 24 hours, the character suffers a -2 penalty on all skill and ability checks.
  8     Seh         The character is paralyzed for 2d12 hours, as with *[hold monster]*, except he cannot attempt new saving throws to overcome the effect.
  9     Kog         For the next week, the character emits a horrible smell. He suffers a -4 penalty on [Diplomacy] checks.
  10    Vis         Once, during the next 24 hours, the character can reroll a single die roll he has just made and take the second result, as if using the good fortune ability from the Luck domain.
  11    Fyeh        The character gains 100 points of fire immunity, as if using *[protection from energy]*.
  12    Xal         The character gains the benefits of a *[heroism]* spell for the next 200 minutes.
  13    Yaq         For the next 24 hours, when the character hits a target he is flanking with a melee weapon, the attack does +1d6 points of precision damage.
  14    Gib         Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast *[faerie fire]* (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the *[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* before the 24 hours is concluded.
  15    Xku         The character is immune to fear for the next 24 hours.
  16    Lev         Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast a *[lightning bolt]* (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the *[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* before the 24 hours is concluded.
  17    Nhi         For the next 7 days, when the character is the target of healing magic, he heals an additional 2d8 hit points. This effect is lost if the character rolls the *[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* again before the 7 days are concluded.
  18    Zmi         For the next 24 hours, whenever the character succeeds on a saving throw against a harmful effect that does half damage or partial effect on a failed save, the *knucklebone's* character takes no damage or suffers no effect.
  19    Tem         For the next 24 hours, the character automatically confirms all critical hits.
  20    Eha-Zah     The next time the character dies, he comes back from the dead the very next morning as if the subject of a *[resurrection]* spell. This effect is negated if the character rolls the *[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* again before he dies.

  : Table: Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune

**Destruction**

The *knucklebone of fickle fortune* disappears if its Eha-Zah face (a 20
on the die) comes up on 20 consecutive rolls. Some sages believe that
this does not destroy the artifact, and it instead reappears at some
random spot in the world, but such knowledge is purely conjecture, for
it is not known whether anyone has accomplished this improbable task.

**Perfect Golden Lute**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

The *perfect golden lute* is said to be a flawless instrument; its tone
and clarity are unrivaled. It is an instrument so fine it practically
performs itself, granting anyone who plays it a +10 competency bonus on
[Perform] (string instruments)
checks with it. A character with ranks in
[Perform] (string instrument) can
play the lute to activate countersong, distraction, or fascinate (as the
bardic performance abilities) as if he were a 1st-level bard, performing
a number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier. If the user
of the *perfect golden lute* is a bard, he adds +2 to the DC of all
bardic performance abilities using the lute, and can use bardic
performance with the lute for an additional 6 rounds per day.

**Destruction**

The *perfect golden lute* shatters into splinters if a day passes in
which no music is played within 1,000 miles of it, or if its bearer is
killed by a bard spell or bardic performance.

**Spindle of Perfect
[Knowledge]**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

The *spindle of perfect knowledge* is large, bright, and flawless
marquise-cut diamond *[ioun
stone]* the size of a
halfling's fist. The gemstone would be a treasure in itself if it lacked
magic, but it is also a powerful *[ioun
stone]*. The *spindle
of perfect knowledge* functions like a *[headband of mental
superiority]*
+4 and grants 5 ranks in two random
[Knowledge] skills. The wearer
can communicate and understand languages as if using *[comprehend
languages]*,
*[tongues]*, and telepathy with a
range of 100 feet.

**Destruction**

The *spindle of perfect knowledge* is destroyed if worn by a mindless
creature for an entire year.

**Talisman of Reluctant Wishes**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A *talisman of reluctant wishes* appears the same as a *stone of
controlling earth elementals*, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an
inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent
on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a *talisman of
reluctant wishes* must make a DC 15 Charisma check.

If the check fails, the talisman acts as a *[stone of
weight]*.
Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the
disappearance of the talisman.

If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6
hours, or until a *[wish]* is made with
it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.

If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of
months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to
get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back
pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like.

The artifact grants one *[wish]* for every
6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and
throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or
magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses
are of no avail.)

Regardless of which reaction results, a *talisman of reluctant wishes*
disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its
stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.

**Destruction**

A *talisman of reluctant wishes* can be destroyed by wishing it so,
using either one of the stone's *wishes* or a
*[wish]* spell from another source. The
stone then explodes, causing 5d6 points of damage to the holder.

  : Table: Rings

These rings follow the normal rules for magic rings as described in the
*Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*.

**Dungeon Ring**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 8th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 16,000 gp (*jailer's ring*), 250 gp
(*prisoner's ring*); **Weight** —

**Description**

A *jailer's [dungeon ring]* is worked gold, set with a
carnelian. The ring is magically attuned to one or more iron *prisoner's
dungeon rings*. When the wearer of a *jailer's ring* places a
*prisoner's ring* on a subject, the prisoner cannot remove the ring
without the use of a *[remove
curse]*, *[limited
wish]*,
*[miracle]*, or
*[wish]* spell. The wearer of the
*jailer's ring* can also remove a linked *prisoner's ring* at any time.

The jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked *prisoner's ring* like a
constant *[status]* spell.
Additionally, all wearers of linked *prisoner's rings* count as familiar
to the jailer for purposes of spells such as
*[scrying]* and
*[teleport]*.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring],
*[scrying]*,
*[status]*; **Cost** 8,000 gp
(*jailer's ring*), 125 gp (*prisoner's ring*)

**Ring of Arcane Signets**

**Aura** faint universal; **CL** 1st

**Slot** ring; **Price** 1,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

The amorphous, approximately 1-inch-square chunk of rosy crystal that
dominates this otherwise plain copper ring forms itself into a specific
rune, sigil, or similar identifying marker each time a person first puts
it on. If the wearer expects this to occur, he can cause the crystal to
adopt any shape he wishes. If the wearer does not expect this to occur,
the crystal instead molds itself into an image that symbolizes the
wearer or some dominant facet of his personality. Once the crystal
assumes this initial form, it always does so whenever the wearer puts on
the ring. The wearer can, as a standard action, embed this image on any
object (as if using *[arcane
mark]*) simply by pressing
the ring against it. The wearer may choose the color and other cosmetic
features of the image each time he uses the ring. The brand is otherwise
permanent unless removed by *[dispel
magic]*,
*[erase]*, or a more powerful spell.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], *[arcane
mark]*; **Cost** 500 gp

**Ring of Delayed Doom**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 45,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This band has nine garnets embedded along its exterior. Whenever the
wearer's mind or body first becomes subject to any harmful effect that
allows a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he may, as an immediate
action, choose to delay the onset of that effect for 1 minute, after he
fails the saving throw but before its effects occur. This activation
causes one of the garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes,
the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an
additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so,
which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another
minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls
unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time
the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not
count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5
rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its
effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the
harmful effect work normally while it is delayed, for example,
*[neutralize
poison]* cast on
the wearer while he delays the effect of a poisonous bite removes the
poison effect.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring],
*[heal]*, *[time
stop]*; **Cost** 22,500 gp

**Ring of Forcefangs**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 8,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This band negates any force spell or spell-like ability targeted at the
wearer. Doing so gives the ring a number of charges equal to the spell
level of the incoming force effect. The ring can hold a maximum of nine
charges. If an incoming force attack would charge the ring beyond this
limit, the ring does not negate the attack or gain charges, and the
attack affects the wearer normally. On command, the wearer can use the
ring's charges to cast *[magic
missile]*, unleashing one
missile (1d4+1 force damage) per charge but no more than five missiles
per round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], [Heighten
Spell], *[magic
missile]*; **Cost** 4,000
gp

**Ring of Maniacal Devices**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** ring; **Price** 5,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This deceptively precious looking ring grants the wearer a +5 competence
bonus on all [Craft] (traps) and
[Disable Device]
checks. Even if he has no ranks in these skills, the wearer may make
[Craft] (traps) and [Disable
Device] checks as if he
were trained in them.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], *[fox's
cunning]*, creator must
have 5 ranks in the relevant skill; **Cost** 2,500 gp

**Ring of Retribution**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 13th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

Once per day, the wearer of this charred bone ring may, as an immediate
action, cause it to detonate in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 10d6
points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). If the wearer is killed by
the detonation, all magical equipment he carries must also save or take
fire damage, and all nonmagical equipment takes this damage with no
saving throw. This explosion never destroys the ring.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], [Quicken
Spell],
*[fireball]*; **Cost** 7,500 gp

**Ring of Revelation**

**Aura** faint or moderate varied; **CL** 5th (lesser), 7th (greater),
or 11th (superior)

**Slot** ring; **Price** 10,000 gp (lesser), 16,000 gp (greater), 24,000
gp (superior); **Weight** —

**Description**

A *[ring of revelation]* is a divine item attuned
to a particular oracular mystery and containing a revelation associated
with that mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the
ring, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she
had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate
mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level requirements (if any)
of the revelation itself; for example, a *[ring of
revelation]*(combat healer) is only usable by an
oracle of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the oracle
already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a
limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one
additional time per day. The ring has no effect if worn by a non-oracle.

A *lesser [ring of revelation]* contains a
revelation that has no level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less
than 6th level. A *greater [ring of revelation]*
contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 7th level or
higher. A *superior [ring of revelation]* contains
a revelation that requires the oracle to be 11th level or higher.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], creator
must be an oracle with the desired revelation; **Cost** 5,000 gp
(lesser), 8,000 gp (greater), 12,000 gp (superior)

  : Table: Rods

Rods are scepter-like devices that have unique magical powers and do not
usually have charges. Many have unique control over the flow of magic.
Anyone can use a rod (though metamagic rods have no effect when used by
creatures that cannot cast spells). Normal metamagic rods can be used
with spells of 6th level or lower. Lesser rods can be used with spells
of 3rd level or lower, while greater rods can be used with spells of 9th
level or lower.

^1^Add to the enhancement bonus on [Table:
Weapons] to determine
total market price.

^2^Bows, crossbows, and slings crafted with this ability bestow this
power upon their ammunition.

^3^Reroll if you get a duplicate special ability, an ability
incompatible with an ability that you've already rolled, or if the extra
ability puts you over the +10 limit. A weapon's enhancement bonus and
special ability bonus equivilents can't total more than +10.

A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement
bonus.

**Allying**: An *[allying] weapon* allows the wielder to
transfer some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus to one weapon
being used by an ally of the wielder. The wielder must have line of
sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her turn
before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate her
weapon's enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally's weapon lasts until
the *[allying] weapon*'s wielder's next turn. The enhancement
bonus from the *[allying] weapon* does not stack with the
enhancement bonus on the ally's weapon (if any).

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[magic
weapon]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Conductive**: A conductive weapon is able to channel the energy of a
spell-like or supernatural ability that relies on a melee or ranged
touch attack to hit its target (such as from a cleric's domain granted
power, sorcerer's bloodline power, oracle's mystery revelation, or
wizard's arcane school power). When the wielder makes a successful
attack of the appropriate type, he may choose to expend two uses of his
magical ability to channel it through the weapon to the struck opponent,
who takes the effects of the weapon attack and the special ability. (If
the wielder has unlimited uses of a special ability, he may channel
through the weapon every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an
undead opponent with her *[conductive] greatsword*can
expend two uses of lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch
attack) to deal greatsword damage and damage from one use of her lay on
hands. This weapon property can only be used once per round, and only
works with magical abilities of the same type as the weapon (melee or
ranged).

Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[spectral
hand]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Corrosive**: Upon command, a *[corrosive] weapon* becomes
slick with acid that deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage on a
successful hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. The effect remains
until another command is given.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[acid
arrow]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Corrosive Burst**: A corrosive burst weapon functions as a corrosive
weapon that explodes with acid upon striking a successful critical hit.
The acid does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra acid damage
from the corrosive ability, a *[corrosive burst]
weapon* deals an extra 1d10 points of acid damage on a successful
critical hit. If the weapon's critical modifier is ×3, add an extra 2d10
points of acid damage instead, and if the modifier is ×4, add an extra
3d10 points.

Even if the *[corrosive]*ability is not active, the weapon
still deals its extra acid damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 12th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[acid
arrow]*; Price +2 bonus.

**Cunning**: This special ability allows a weapon to find chinks in a
foe's defenses using the wielder's knowledge of the target. Whenever the
weapon's attack is a critical threat, the wielder gains a +2 bonus on
the confirmation roll if she has 5 or more ranks in the
[Knowledge] skill related to the
target's creature type (such as
[Knowledge] [planes] for an
outsider opponent).

Moderate divination; CL 6th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[true
strike]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Dueling**: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A
dueling weapon (which must be a weapon that can be used with the [Weapon
Finesse] feat) gives the wielder a +4
enhancement bonus on initiative checks, provided the weapon is drawn and
in hand when the Initiative check is made. It provides a +2 bonus on
disarm checks and feint checks, a +2 bonus to CMD to resist disarm
attempts, and a +2 to the DC to perform a feint against the wielder.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[cat's
grace]*; Price +14,000 gp.

**Furious**: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A
*[furious] weapon* serves as a focus for its wielder's anger.
When the wielder is raging or under the effect of a
*[rage]* spell, the weapon's enhancement
bonus is +2 better than normal. If the wielder has a rage power that
gives a skill bonus while raging (such as raging climber, raging leaper,
or raging swimmer), the wielder gains an enhancement bonus to that skill
whenever the weapon is wielded or held in hand, even when not raging;
this bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus of the weapon (including
the +2 when the wielder is raging).

Moderate enchantment (compulsion); CL 8th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], rage; Price +1
bonus.

**Grayflame**: This weapon responds to channeled positive or negative
energy. When the wielder spends a swift action to channel energy through
the weapon, it ignites with a strange gray flame that sheds light as a
torch, increases the weapon's enhancement bonus by +1, and deals +1d6
damage (as the divine power from *[flame
strike]*) to creatures
struck by the weapon. This flame lasts for 1 round for every d6 damage
or healing the channeling normally provides. When charged with positive
energy, the flame is a silvery gray, good creatures are immune to the
weapon's extra damage, and the weapon counts as a good and silver weapon
for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. When charged with
negative energy, the flame is an ashen gray, evil creatures are immune
to the weapon's extra damage, and the weapon counts as an evil and cold
iron weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

Moderate transmutation; CL 6th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], [Channel
Smite], *[align
weapon]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Huntsman**: A huntsman weapon helps its wielder locate and capture
quarry. When the weapon is held in hand, the wielder gains an
enhancement bonus on [Survival]
checks made to track any creature the weapon has damaged in the past
day. It deals +1d6 damage to creatures the wielder has tracked with
[Survival] in the past day.

Moderate divination; CL 7th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[detect animals
or
plants]*;
Price +1 bonus.

**Jurist**: When an inquisitor wielder uses her judgment class ability,
this weapon grants her an enhancement bonus on her
[Perception] checks and CMD.
The bonus is +1 on the first round of her judgment, and increases by +1
each round, to a maximum of +3 on the third and following rounds.

Moderate transmutation; CL 4th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[owl's
wisdom]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Menacing**: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. This
weapon property helps allies deal with flanked foes. When the wielder is
adjacent to a creature that is being flanked by an ally, the flanking
bonus on attack rolls for all flanking allies increases by +2. This
ability works even if the wielder is not one of the characters flanking
the creature.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[phantasmal
killer]*; Price
+1 bonus.

**Transformative**: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A
*[transformative] weapon* alters its shape at its
wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general
shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as simple, martial, or
exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium
*[transformative] longsword* can take the shape of any
other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or
trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a
Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape
of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small
greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is
a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very
similar to a Medium longsword; a Small
*[transformative] greatsword* can become an actual
Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the -2 penalty for
using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its
abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon properties, except
those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a
*[keen]
[transformative] weapon* functions normally in the form
of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the
*[keen]* property when in
the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts
to its true shape.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[major
creation]*; Price
+10,000 gp.

  : Table: Specific Weapons

**Beaststrike Club**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th

**Slot** none; **Price** 7,300 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 club* is often decorated with large teeth and carved with
stylized images of different animals. As a standard action, the wielder
may transform the club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's
damage does not change but the type of damage changes to suit the shape
of the club: bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam
(bludgeoning), sting (piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed,
the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the
purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either
manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural
weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that
rely on specific natural weapons, such as [Weapon
Focus] (bite) or the *[bloody
claws]* spell. If the wielder
has the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wild shape to
increase the weapon's damage by one step for the duration of that wild
shape as long as the druid remains in contact with the weapon; if the
wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always increased in
this fashion. If unattended, the club reverts to its normal shape.

*[shillelagh]*; **Cost** 3,800
gp

**Blade of Binding**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** none; **Price** 12,350 gp; **Weight** 8 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 greatsword* is decorated with a chain motif. On a successful
hit with the sword against a creature of the wielder's size or smaller
creature, the wielder can attempt to start a grapple as a free action
that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If the wielder succeeds
at the grapple, the sword blade transforms into a metal chain and wraps
around the target, giving the wielder a +5 bonus on further grapple
checks against the target. If the target escapes the grapple or the
wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain
reverts to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle).

The wielder can also let go of the chain's handle while grappling or
pinning the target; if so, the chain remains in place and the target
gains the entangled condition ([Escape
Artist] DC 20 to slip
free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration DC 17 to
cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain's
handle as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a
swift action, which releases the bound creature. If the chain is
destroyed, it reverts to sword form and the weapon gains the broken
condition.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[animate

**Boulderhead Mace**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 6,812 gp; **Weight** 8 lbs.

**Description**

The head of this *+1 heavy mace* is made from a single piece of roughly
spherical granite. Once per day the wielder can command the mace to
release this head, which grows to the size of a Large boulder and rolls
quickly in a direction the wielder specifies. The boulder rolls in a
straight line up to 60 feet, trampling everything in its path for 3d8+5
damage (Reflex half DC 19). The boulder collapses into rubble and dust
at the end of its path or if it encounters an obstacle it cannot break
through or roll over, creating a 10-foot-square area of difficult
terrain. A new stone mace-head grows on the weapon's haft over the next
24 hours, and it is unusable as a weapon until the head regrows.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[wall of
stone]*; **Cost** 3,652 gp

**Dustburst Bullet**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 196 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

**Description**

This gritty and irregular *+1 sling bullet*explodes into a cloud of
choking dust when it successfully strikes its target. This fills a
5-foot cube and follows the target for 1d6 rounds before dispersing. Any
creature ending its turn in the cloud must make a DC 13 Fortitude save
or be sickened and blinded for 1 round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[stinking
cloud]*; **Cost** 98 gp

**Guarding Blade**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** none; **Price** 65,310 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 [dancing] short
sword* automatically rises up to defend a fallen or sleeping wielder. To
trigger the sword's activation, the wielder must fall unconscious or die
while wielding the weapon or holding it in hand. Thereafter, should any
creature other than an ally of the wielder attempt to touch or strike
him with melee attacks, the sword attacks that creature for up to 4
rounds. After 4 rounds, the weapon drops in the wielder's square. Unless
the *[guarding blade]* is an intelligent item, it
lacks the wits to make decisions about which is the best opponent to
attack, and when confronted by multiple opponents attacking the wielder
it tends to select a random target each round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[animate
objects]*, *[mage's
faithful
hound]*;
**Cost** 32,810 gp

**Lance of Jousting**

**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 4,310 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

**Description**

This ornately designed *+1 lance* streams with ribbons and small favors,
allowing a wielder to more effectively knock an opponent from his mount.
A successful hit with a *[lance of jousting]* on a
mounted opponent forces the target to make a
[Ride] check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to
avoid being knocked from the saddle. Although used in combat to remove a
mounted foe's advantage, use of a *[lance of
jousting]* in a tournament or similar contest is
generally considered a dishonorable form of cheating.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[bull's
strength]*; **Cost**
2,105 gp

**Ricochet Hammer**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Price** 20,301 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 [returning]
[light] hammer* can strike multiple foes
with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high
base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first
target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder's
additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range
of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf
fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away
(within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets
it to a attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the
first target (within three range increments for a -4 range penalty). The
hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses,
it stops ricocheting and has no further attacks that round, and returns
as normal for a weapon with the
*[returning]*
property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks,
modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as *[true
strike]*) only apply to the
first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the
wielder's additional attacks for that round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor],
*[telekinesis]*; **Cost**
10,301 gp

**Shieldsplitter Lance**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 18,310; **Weight** 10 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 [keen] lance* has
the ability to penetrate and destroy shields. Whenever its wielder uses
it to successfully strike an opponent who carries a shield, the
opponent's shield takes the same damage as the opponent. If the wielder
uses the lance to make a sunder attack against a shield, it bypasses the
shield's hardness.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[keen
edge]*,
*[shatter]*; **Cost** 9,310 gp

**Searing Arrow**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 1,516 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This *+1 [flaming]
arrow* continues to burn its target each round, dealing 1d6 fire damage
on the attacker's turn for the next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow
requires a DC 10 [Heal] check and prevents
any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target
tries to remove the arrow from himself). Removing the arrow destroys it,
and it burns up once the 3 rounds pass.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[flame
blade]*, *[flame
strike]*, or
*[fireball]*; **Cost** 758 gp

**Sizzling Arrow**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 1,516 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This *+1 [corrosive] arrow* continues to leak acid onto its
target each round, dealing 1d6 acid damage on the attacker's turn for
the next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow is a DC 10
[Heal] check and prevents any further
damage from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target tries to
remove the arrow from himself). Removing the arrow destroys it, and it
dissolves up once the 3 rounds pass.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[acid
arrow]*; **Cost** 758 gp

**Sparkwake Starknife**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 8th

**Slot** none; **Price** 21,324 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

A faint trail of sparks marks the passage of this *+1
[shock] starknife*
whenever it is thrown. Once per day its wielder may throw it so it
transforms into an 8d6 *[lightning
bolt]* (Reflex DC 14
half), returning to its physical form at the end of the bolt's path.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[lightning
bolt]*; **Cost** 10,824

**Spirit Blade**

**Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 48,502 gp; **Weight** 1 lbs.

**Description**

This almost transparently thin weapon is often decorated with strange
faces and swirling mist. In addition to being a *+3 [ghost
touch] dagger*, it
can cast *[dispel magic]*
once per day.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[dispel

**Tangle Bolt**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none; **Price** 226 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

Often etched with images of spider webs or swampy vines, this sickly
green *+1 [seeking]
bolt* transforms into sticky goo when it hits, entangling its target and
becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. In addition to the
bolt damage, the target is entangled as if it had been hit by a
tanglefoot bag.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], *[true
seeing]* and
*[web]* or creator must have 5 ranks in
[Craft] (alchemy); **Cost** 113 gp

**Trident of Stability**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** none; **Price** 9,815 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The base of this sturdy but tarnished *+1 trident* has a wide metal bar
at the bottom, perfectly situated to serve as a solid footrest or other
sort of handle. The bar acts as an *[immovable
rod]*, except instead of an
activation button, the immobility power triggers whenever the wielder
places one or both feet on the bar, and ends whenever the wielder is no
longer touching the bar with at least one foot. If the wielder remains
in place and steps on the bar, he gains a +10 bonus to his CMD when
trying to resist efforts to move him. The wielder is always considered
braced against oncoming charge attacks. If the wielder is falling, he
may step on the bar as an immediate action to halt his fall, though the
sudden jolt means he takes falling damage for the current distance
fallen.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor],
*[levitate]*; **Cost** 5,065 gp

**Undercutting Axe**

**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 23,310 gp; **Weight** 6 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 giant-bane battleaxe* feels unusually heavy, as if it were made
from something far heavier than mere wood and steel. Once per day its
wearer can, as a swift action after a successful attack roll, invoke a
maximized *[ray of
enfeeblement]*
on the creature struck (11 point Strength penalty, 7 rounds, Fortitude
DC 16 for half).

# Wondrous Items

Wondrous items is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall
into the other groups of magic items. Any creature can use a wondrous
item (unless specified otherwise in the description, such as requiring a
particular class feature).

**All Tools Vest**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** chest; **Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

The stitching along the many pockets of this light leather vest depicts
cheerful laborers going about their daily work. Once per day, as a
standard action, the wearer can speak its command word and order it to
bring forth all the standard tools required to make checks for any one
[Craft] skill. These tools appear in the
countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a
nearby shelf, on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears
nearby. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until another
creature touches them, whichever comes first.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[summon
instrument]*;
**Cost** 900 gp

**Amulet of Magecraft**

**Aura** moderate universal; **CL** 9th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 20,000 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

Each silver link that makes up this heavy necklace represents a
well-known concept of arcane theory. A universalist wizard who selects
the necklace as his bonded object (which counts as an amulet) may choose
one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use
the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that
school into any other wizard spell of that school he knows; the desired
spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For
example, if the wizard chose “evocation” when he prepared his spells
that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can
spontaneously convert a prepared
*[fireball]* into any other
evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item],
*[permanency]*, creator must
be a universalist; **Cost** 10,000 gp

**Amulet of Spell Cunning**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This silver locket only has power when used as a wizard's bonded object.
It allows a wizard to prepare an additional 3 levels of spells per day.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[mnemonic
enhancer]*;
**Cost** 5,000 gp

**Annihilation Spectacles**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** eyes; **Price** 25,000 gp; **Weight** 1/4 lb.

**Description**

Creatures viewed through these darkly tinted glasses sometimes seem,
ever so briefly, to flicker in and out of existence. A transmuter can
use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard
transmutation spell into any other wizard transmutation spell he knows;
the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared
spell. Once per day, he may use the spectacles to spontaneously cast
*[disintegrate]* in place
of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells of 6th level or
higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item],
*[disintegrate]*, creator
must be a transmuter; **Cost** 12,500 gp

**Apple of Eternal Sleep**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 2,500 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This beautiful, ripe red apple appears fresh and tempting. Should anyone
bite into it (even a small taste), he must make an immediate DC 19 Will
saving throw or be stricken by [eternal
sleep], the same as the
witch's hex of that name. The victim can only be awakened by a casting
of *[break
enchantment]*,
*[limited wish]*,
*[wish]*, or
*[miracle]*, or by a kiss from
someone of royal blood.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Brew Potion], [Craft
Wondrous Item], eternal sleep
hex; **Cost** 1,125 gp

**Assisting Glove**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 1st

**Slot** hands; **Price** 180 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

The wearer of this simple glove can speak a command word to transform it
into a glowing disembodied hand. As a swift action, the wearer can have
the glove assist him with a task as if using the aid another action; the
glove uses the wearer's base attack bonus or skill ranks when making the
check to see if aid another is successful (it does not gain the benefit
of the wearer's ability scores or other bonuses). The hand remains until
it has attempted one action or until 1 minute passes, whichever comes
first, at which time it becomes a nonmagical lambskin glove.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[mage
hand]*, *[unseen
servant]*; **Cost** 90
gp

**Bandages of Rapid Recovery**

**Aura** faint conjuration (healing); **CL** 1st

**Slot** chest; **Price** 200 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the feathers of
a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less natural origin. Any
creature wrapped in these bandages recovers from wounds and ability
damage each day as if receiving complete bed rest regardless of activity
(*Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*191). A creature actually receiving
long-term care (from the [Heal] skill) or
complete bed rest while wearing the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its
effective level or Hit Dice when determining how many hit points it
recovers each day. The bandages are destroyed once removed or when the
wearer recovers all hit points and ability damage, whichever comes
first.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[cure light
wounds]*, *[lesser
restoration]*,
*[stabilize]*; **Cost** 100 gp

**Book of the Loremaster**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This digest-sized book contains a seemingly random collection of words,
phrases, and strange mnemonic aids. Three times each day, a bard can
consult it while using the lore master class feature in order to gain a
+5 competence bonus when taking 10 or taking 20 on a
[Knowledge] check.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item],
*[clairaudience/clairvoyance]*;
**Cost** 7,500 gp

**Boots of Friendly Terrain**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** feet; **Price** 2,400 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

Each pair of these supple leather boots corresponds to a specific sort
of environment as defined by the ranger's favored terrain class feature
(jungle, plains, and so on). A ranger wearing the boots can treat the
corresponding environment of the boots as one of his favored terrains,
granting him a +2 bonus. If he already has that particular environment
as one of his favored terrains, his bonus for that terrain increases by
+2.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[pass without
trace]*, creator
must be a ranger; **Cost** 1,200 gp

**Bottle of Messages**

**Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** none; **Price** 300 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This green glass bottle has a tiny winding key on its elongated stem
that, if turned, causes a shadowy cork to slowly become substantial over
a 1-round period. Anything the owner of the bottle speaks into the
bottle during this time (up to 25 words) gets trapped inside it once the
cork fully manifests. As soon as the cork is removed or the bottle is
smashed, this message is released exactly as if the owner had spoken the
words at that moment. Once the bottle releases its message, it shatters.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[magic
mouth]*; **Cost** 150 gp

**Bracelet of Mercy**

**Aura** faint conjuration (healing); **CL** 5th

**Slot** wrist; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

Each gem in this metal bracelet has a tiny inscription from a holy book.
If the wearer has the mercy class feature, she gains the diseased mercy.
If the wearer already has that mercy, her effective caster level for
removing diseases increases by +4.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[remove
disease]*; **Cost**
7,500 gp

**Campfire Bead**

**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 1st

**Slot** none; **Price** 720 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This tiny glass bead transforms itself into a small (2-foot-tall) pile
of burning logs whenever its command word is spoken. The fire burns for
8 hours or until extinguished, at which point it turns back into a bead.
The owner of the item must wait twice as long as the fire burned before
he can order the bead to become a campfire again.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[produce
flame]*; **Cost** 360 gp

**Catching Cape**

**Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** shoulders; **Price** 200 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its
owner takes. The wearer can, as a swift action, order the cape to
transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides.
The field grants the wearer a concealment (20% miss chance) against
ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a
ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first. When
the field ends, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane
silvery garment.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item],
*[shield]*; **Cost** 100 gp

**Cauldron of Brewing**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 3,000 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

A *cauldron of brewing* looks like a fine cooking pot with four stout
legs. The cauldron is capable of heating any liquid placed in it to a
precise temperature (anywhere from just above room temperature to hot
enough to boil salt water) and maintaining it indefinitely while still
remaining only slightly warm to the touch on the outside. A *cauldron of
brewing* provides a +5 competence bonus on
[Craft] (alchemy) skill checks.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], trained in
[Craft] (Alchemy); **Cost** 1,500 gp

**Cauldron of Flying**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 40,000 gp; **Weight** 100 lbs.

**Description**

This iron pot is large enough for two Medium humanoids to stand in
comfortably. Upon command, the cauldron and up to 500 pounds of
additional weight can fly as if using *[overland
flight]*. The
cauldron moves under the direction of the person who spoke the
activating command word. It can carry up to double its capacity, but
doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It can hover in place without the
need for a [Fly] skill check. The cauldron
provides partial cover for anyone standing in it. It has a hardness of
10 and 60 hit points.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[overland
flight]*; **Cost**
20,000 gp

**Cauldron of Plenty**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 25 lbs.

**Description**

This enchanted iron pot can produce nourishing, simple fare sufficient
to feed up to 36 people per day upon command. Once per week it can also
be commanded to create a *[heroes'
feast]* for up to 12
people. The cauldron needs neither fire nor ingredients to produce food;
it does so instantly upon command.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[create food and
water]*,
*[heroes' feast]*; **Cost**
7,500 gp

**Cauldron of Resurrection**

**Aura** strong conjuration (healing); **CL** 13th

**Slot** none; **Price** 33,000 gp; **Weight** 35 lbs.

**Description**

The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a monstrous
maw and is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When
the cauldron is filled with pure water and certain rare and sacred
herbs, and a deceased creature is placed inside it, the cauldron can
restore the creature to life as if from a *[raise
dead]* or
*[resurrection]* spell.
The spell effect depends on the components used: *[raise
dead]* costs 5,000 gp worth of
materials, while
*[resurrection]* costs
10,000 gp worth of materials. The cauldron can function once per day.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item],
*[resurrection]*; **Cost**
16,500 gp

**Cauldron of Seeing**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 42,000 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

When filled with liquid, this small cauldron allows the user to see over
virtually any distance as if using the
*[scrying]* spell. It may have
additional powers like those of a *[crystal
ball]* for the same
prices.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item],
*[scrying]*; **Cost** 21,000 gp

**Cauldron of the Dead**

**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 30,000 gp; **Weight** 35 lbs.

**Description**

This cauldron of dark iron is large enough to accommodate a single
Medium creature. When filled with a mixture of water and rare herbs, the
cauldron transforms any dead body placed in it into a zombie as if
animated by an *[animate
dead]* spell. Each corpse
animated uses up 25 gp in materials per Hit Die, and the cauldron can
animate one corpse per round. The user of the cauldron commands the
undead so created—up to 12 HD, unless the user can cast the *[animate
dead]* spell, in which case
that spell's limit is used; animating more beyond this limit causes
earlier specimens to become uncontrolled.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[animate
dead]*; **Cost** 15,000 gp

**Clamor Box**

**Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 2,000 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This delicate tin music box can produce a great volume of noise at a
specific time determined by its owner. Four command words determine what
sorts of sounds it is to play (battle, fire, massacre, or riot), and a
fifth determines the delay (anywhere from 1 round to 20 minutes) until
the box begins to produce the desired sound. The noise from the box is
as loud as 40 people. The sound persists for 2d6 rounds.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[ghost
sound]*; **Cost** 1,000 gp

**Construct Channel Brick**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This solid red brick changes its shape to match its bearer's holy
symbol. If the bearer has the channel energy class feature, she can
focus her power on the brick, allowing her to repair damaged constructs
and objects as if they were living creatures. The item works whether the
bearer channels positive or negative energy. If the bearer has the
artifice domain, she adds +2d6 points of damage to her channel energy
result when repairing constructs and objects.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[make
whole]*; **Cost** 5,000 gp

**Cowardly Crouching Cloak**

**Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** shoulders; **Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the wearer's
entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover his face and drop
to a huddling crouch. Any creature seeking to directly attack him while
he does this must make a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the
*[sanctuary]* spell). The wearer
cannot see or take any actions while crouching. This makes him
effectively blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless. The
wearer can end his crouch simply by standing up or moving.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item],
*[sanctuary]*; **Cost** 900 gp

**Crystal of Healing Hands**

**Aura** moderate conjuration (healing); **CL** 10th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 12,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A simple cotton cord holds this glittering prism in place. A person with
the lay on hands class feature can direct one use of this energy into
the crystal, which stores it until the wearer speaks a command word to
release it. Releasing the energy targets the wearer with the stored lay
on hands effect, as if touched by the person who infused the crystal
with its power. The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands
class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a
pearly white light. The wearer of the crystal can order it to release
its energy as a standard action. This acts identically to receiving the
lay on hands directly from the person who channeled it into the crystal,
including any mercies they had at the time.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[cure light
wounds]*, creator
must be a paladin; **Cost** 6,000 gp

**Defoliant Polish**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 800 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one Medium or
two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the
next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as
soon as they come into contact with the affected armor. This allows the
wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the presence of
vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the creature leaves a
clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the
plant type that target someone protected by *defoliant polish* with a
natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful
attack.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[diminish
plants]*; **Cost**
400 gp

**Doomharp**

**Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 4th

**Slot** none; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

Made from bone and sun-dried sinew, this masterwork harp produces a
vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the owner of this item has
the bardic performance class feature he can use it to perform a dirge of
doom even if he is not of sufficient level to normally have access to
that ability. A bard who can use dirge of doom and who plays the harp as
part of his performance increases the effective radius to 60 feet.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous
Item], *[cause
fear]*; **Cost** 5,000 gp

**Dust of Emulation**

**Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 1st

**Slot** none; **Price** 800 gp ; **Weight** —

**Description**

A creature coated with this glittering golden dust can interact with any
one item or object as if she had successfully used the [Use Magic
Device] skill to
emulate a class feature or race (if the exact result of the check

effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It
normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble.

A *lord's banner* may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the

a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design). The
banner displays the faith's holy symbol along with the owner's crest.

*Swiftness*: A group or army that are traveling under a *lord's banner
of swiftness* can make a forced march without needing Constitution
checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to
cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This
ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are
able to see the banner at least once a day.

*Terror*: Enemies of the bearer of a *lord's banner of terror*, while
within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw
(DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long

creature that makes its saving throw cannot be panicked by the banner
for 1 day.

morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as
they can see the banner.

darkvision out to 60 feet (if she does not already possess it). Its
other effects only benefit a wearer capable of casting arcane spells.

During the waxing moon, the wearer's caster level is considered one
higher for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects; during the
three nights of the full moon, this benefit increases to two levels
higher than normal. However, this additional power comes with a price.
During the waning moon, the wearer's caster level is considered one
lower for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects, and during
the three nights of the new moon, this penalty increases to two levels
lower.

Removing a *moon circlet* imposes 2 negative levels on the wearer until
the next full moon (or until the *circlet* is worn again, whichever
comes first). These negative levels cannot be restored by any means
short of a *[limited
