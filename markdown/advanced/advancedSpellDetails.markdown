# Spells

## Absorbing Touch

**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** touch

**Target** object touched

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (object); **Spell Resistance** no

You absorb the next object your hand touches into your body. If you are
already holding an object, you can attempt to absorb it; otherwise, you
may touch an object as a standard action separate from casting the
spell. You can absorb any nonmagical, nonliving object weighing no more
than 1 pound per caster level. A container and its contents count as a
single object. Objects in the possession of another creature receive a
Fortitude saving throw to prevent absorption. You may continue to
attempt to absorb objects until one is absorbed.

An absorbed object melds with your hand and cannot be targeted, but the
object's weight still counts against your carrying capacity. If you
dismiss the spell, the item appears in the hand that absorbed it, or
falls to the ground if that hand is full. Multiple castings let you
absorb additional items, but you can only store a single item per hand.



## Accelerate Poison


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a thorn)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You hasten the onset of poison in the target. If the poison normally has
an onset time, its effects begin immediately. If the poison has no onset
time, its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and
inflicting damage twice per round or minute, though its duration is
halved. *[Accelerate poison]* does not change the
cure condition for the poison. If the target is affected by more than
one poison, you may choose which is affected if you administered the
poison; otherwise, randomly determine which poison is affected.



## Acid Pit


**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4,
summoner 4

**Components** V, S, M (drop of acid), F (Fine shovel worth 10 gp)

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; see text; **Spell Resistance** no

This spell functions as *[create pit]*,
except that it places a 5-foot-deep pool of acid at the bottom of the
pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into
the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding
surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with
the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit
may be harmed. Refer to Table 9-2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks
(*Core Rulebook* 216). Items are affected one at a time in the order
listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive
rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken
condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude
saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls
of the pit are quite slippery and have a
[Climb] DC of 30.



## Alchemical Allocation


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round

This extract causes a pale aura to emanate from your mouth. If you
consume a potion or elixir on the round following the consumption of
this extract, you can spit it back into its container as a free action.
You gain all the benefits of the potion or elixir, but it is not
consumed. You can only gain the benefits of one potion or elixir in this
way per use of this extract.



## Allfood


**School** transmutation; **Level** ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of salt and pepper)

**Range** touch

**Target** object touched, weighing up to 5 lbs./level

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes
(object)

You can transform one object, weighing up to 5 lbs. per caster level,
into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and
safely digest. This *[allfood]* always has a bland taste and
slightly gooey consistency when chewed regardless of its original
nature. One pound of *[allfood]* provides enough sustenance
to support a Medium creature for an entire day.

Objects of similar nature in close proximity, such as a pile of rocks,
count as a single object for the purpose of this spell. You cannot use
this spell to transform objects with magical or other exceptional
qualities. An object's hardness is considered to be 0 for the purposes
of eating it, but it retains its normal hardness for all other
situations, and becomes no more vulnerable to sunder attacks, break
attempts, or any other action typically directed against objects.
Objects such as hot coals or a burning torch continue to produce energy
even after you transform them into *[allfood]* and if a
creature attempts to eat such an object, it takes damage accordingly.



## Alter Winds


**School** transmutation [air]; **Level** druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Area** immobile 10-ft.-radius emanation

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You subtly enhance or diminish the effects of natural winds within the
spell's area, which is an immobile emanation around a point touched by
you as the spell is cast. Within the area, natural (but not magical)
wind effects are either increased or decreased by one step in intensity
(*Core Rulebook* 439). The maximum wind force you can affect with this
spell is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.
*[Alter winds]* has no effect on magical wind effects.

  Caster Level     Wind Force
  ---------------- ------------
  1st-3rd          Light
  4th-9th          Moderate
  10th-15th        Strong
  16th or higher   Severe



## Amplify Elixir


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

This extract greatly enhances the effects of any potion or elixir you
consume. For the duration of this extract, any potion or elixir you
consume is treated as if it were empowered. Increase all variable
numeric effects of the potion or elixir by half. If the potion or elixir
does not have any variable numeric effects, it is instead treated as if
it were extended (double the duration of the potion or elixir). If the
potion or elixir does not have any variable numeric effects, or has an
instantaneous duration, *[amplify elixir]* has no
effect. *[Amplify elixir]* affects oils that target
you, but it has no effect on oils that target your equipment.



## Ant Haul


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 1, cleric 1, druid 1,
ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a small pulley)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 2 hours/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

The target's [carrying capacity] triples. This
does not affect the creature's actual Strength in any way, merely the
amount of material it can carry while benefiting from this spell. It
also has no effect on encumbrance due to armor. If the creature wears
armor it still takes the normal penalties for doing so regardless of how
much weight the spell allows it to carry.



## Aqueous Orb


**School** conjuration (creation) [water]; **Level** druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of water and a glass bead)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** 10-ft.-diameter sphere

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; **Spell Resistance** no

You create a rolling sphere of churning water that can engulf those it
strikes. The *[aqueous orb]* can move up to 30 feet per
round, rolling over barriers less than 10 feet tall. It automatically
quenches any nonmagical fires and functions as *[dispel magic]* against magical
fires as long as those fires are size Large or less.

Any creature in the path of the *[aqueous orb]* takes 2d6
points of nonlethal damage. A successful Reflex save negates this
damage, but a large or smaller creature that fails its save must make a
second save or be engulfed by the *[aqueous orb]* and
carried along with it. Engulfed creatures are immersed in water and must
hold their breath unless capable of breathing water. They gain cover
against attacks from outside the *[aqueous orb]* but are
considered entangled by its churning currents, takes 2d6 points of
nonlethal damage at the beginning of their turn each round they remain
trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt a new Reflex save each
round to escape into a random square adjacent to the *[aqueous orb]*. The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium, or
16 Small or smaller creatures within it.

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for
you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and churns in place. An
*[aqueous orb]* stops if it moves outside the spell's
range.



## Arcane Concordance


**School** evocation; **Level** bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a spent wand)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance** no

A shimmering, blue and gold radiance surrounds you, enhancing arcane
spells cast by your allies within its area. Any arcane spell cast by a
creature within the area gains a +1 enhancement bonus to the DC of any
saving throws against the spell, and can be cast as if one of the
following metamagic feats was applied to it (without increasing the
spell level or casting time): [Enlarge Spell], [Extend Spell], [Silent Spell], or [Still Spell] (you choose the metamagic feat
when you cast *[arcane concordance].

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create exact duplicates of the arrow or crossbow bolt you used to
kill a creature in the previous round and launch one at enemy creatures
within a 30-foot radius of the corpse. You can target one creature per
caster level (maximum 15) within range of the burst and must make a
single attack roll and apply it to each arrow. These duplicate arrows
possess all the intrinsic magical properties of the arrow that killed
the original creature as well as those passed on to it by your bow. They
also enjoy the full benefit of any bonuses or modifiers you applied to
the attack from other magical items, feats, and class or racial
features. However, this spell cannot reproduce any spells or other
limited-use magical effects that you used to enhance that particular
attack. This includes such effects as the *[true strike]* spell, as well as
any area spell you might have placed on the arrow by means of the arcane
archer's imbue arrow class feature.

a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity, your base speed
increases by 20 ft., you can move through any undergrowth (including
magically manipulated undergrowth) at your normal speed, and can even
make a 5-foot step within such terrain. Furthermore, when you are hit
with an attack of opportunity, you can make a single attack with your
antlers against the opponent that hit you as an immediate action. This
attack uses your highest base attack bonus plus your Strength or
Dexterity bonus (your choice) and deals 1d8 points of piercing damage
(if you are Medium; 1d6 points of damage if Small) plus your Strength
modifier on a successful hit. The antlers have a critical multiplier of

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

When you cast this spell you strengthen your paladin's aura of courage.
Until the end of its duration, all allies within that aura are immune to
fear (magical or otherwise). If you do not have the aura of courage

no effect.



## Ball Lightning


**School** evocation [air, electricity]; **Level** druid 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a small iron ring)

**Effect** two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you
indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional
globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum
of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round
and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's
course.

If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round
and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a
successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor
take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.

Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action
for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this
spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and
cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A *[ball lightning]* globe winks out if it exceeds the spell's
range.



## Banish Seeming


**School** abjuration; **Level** inquisitor 3, witch 5

**Components** V, S, M (a cold iron nail)

**Range** touch

**Target** one creature or object

**Duration** instantaneous and 1 round/level; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return a
creature to its natural form. This functions as *[dispel magic]* directed at the
effect in question, except you receive a +2 enhancement bonus on your
dispel check and you can only dispel illusions or changes in form
created by supernatural effects or spells. If multiple effects are
changing the creature's appearance, you can dispel one such effect for
every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest caster
level spells and proceeding to spells with lower caster levels. The
caster level for supernatural abilities such as change shape is equal to
the target creature's Hit Dice. A creature returned to its natural form
by *[banish seeming]* is prevented from changing its
form again for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.

*[Banish seeming]* has no effect on nonmagical means of
changing appearance, such as that provided by a disguise or
extraordinary ability.



## Bard's Escape


**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** bard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (pieces of a smashed fiddle)

transfer yourselves to another location to achieve greater strategic
positioning. You can move any allies within range to any other space of
your choosing within range. Those spaces need not be in line of sight or
line of effect from your original position, but must be open locations
on surfaces able to support the creatures teleported. Except as noted
above, this spell otherwise functions as *[dimension door]*.



## Beguiling Gift


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 1,
witch 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (the object to be offered)

**Range** 5 ft.

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into using or
consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its Will save, it
immediately takes the offered object, dropping an already held object if
necessary. On its next turn, it consumes or dons the object, as
appropriate for the item in question. For example, an apple would be
eaten, a potion consumed, a ring put on a finger, and a sword wielded in
a free hand. If the target is physically unable to accept the object,
the spell fails. The subject is under no obligation to continue
consuming or using the item once the spell's duration has expired,
although it may find a cursed item difficult to be rid of.



## Bestow Grace

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

With this spell you can bestow your divine grace on another good
creature for a short amount of time, infusing that creature with a

**Duration** instantaneous and 1 round/level; see text

**Saving Throw** Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You fall unconscious but also unleash a spectacular wave of holy energy
that heartens and heals your allies while leaving your opponents daunted
and damaged. You can cast this spell as either a standard action on your
turn, or as an immediate action when brought to below 0 hit points. If
cast as a standard action, you are immediately reduced to -1 hit points,
but stable, after casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, any good creature within range is healed for
1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. All evil creatures within
range take the same amount as damage instead (a successful Will save
halves this damage). In addition, all allies and enemies within range
are affected as if by the *[prayer]*
spell for 1 round per caster level.



## Blessing of Courage and Life


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level (see below)

(harmless)

With this prayer you provide long-lasting succor to a wounded creature.
For as long as the effect lasts, the target receives a +2 morale bonus
on saving throws against fear and death effects. At any time while the
spell is in effect, the target can choose to end the spell as a swift
action for a burst of healing energy. The target loses the saving throw
bonus, but is healed of 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level
(maximum +10).



## Blessing of Fervor

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

With this blessing, you call your allies to move forth and empower them
to conquer and become victorious. Each round for the duration of this
spell, each of your allies can choose one of the following bonuses for
that round at the beginning of its turn (their choice).

-   Increase its speed by 30 feet.
-   Stand up as a swift action without provoking an attack of
    opportunity.
-   Make one extra attack as part of a full attack action, using its
    highest base attack bonus.

    Reflex saves.
-   Cast a single spell of 2nd level or lower as if it were an enlarged,
    extended, silent, or still spell.

These effects are not cumulative with similar effects, such as those
provided by *[haste]* or a
*[speed]* weapon, nor do
they actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a
second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round. *[Blessing
of fervor]* does not stack with
*[haste]*.

You learn the answers to a specific set of questions about a creature so
long as you have access to at least one drop of its blood. You can cast
this spell on the blood of the living or the dead, but living or undead
creatures are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell. You can
cast the spell on dried or fresh blood. Once you cast the spell the
answers to the following four questions appear on any flat surface you
designate (a wall, a piece of paper, and so on).

-   Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most commonly known)
-   What are you? (Gender, race, profession/role)
-   How was your blood shed? (Brief outline of the events that caused

You borrow one of the target's known skills. After touching the subject,
you can make a single check with the chosen skill using the subject's
skill ranks, but modified by your own key ability. If you take longer
than the spell's duration to make the check or the check requires more
time, then it fails and you must use your own skill ranks (if any). If
the borrowed skill is a class skill for you, you gain the +3 bonus on
checks using that skill.



## Bow Spirit


**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** ranger 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target**you

**Duration** 1 round/level

A *[bow spirit]* is a shapeless force that hovers about
you, taking ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as
the *[bow spirit]* lasts, you can spend a swift action to
direct the *[bow spirit]* to fire an arrow or a bolt at a
target of your choice, as if the *[bow spirit]* were firing
the necessary ranged weapon. The *[bow spirit] uses* your
base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as any bonuses
and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses
from the ammunition it uses. A *[bow spirit]*'s attacks do
not provoke attacks of opportunity. There must be ammunition available
for the *[bow spirit]* to use, and it expends ammunition as
if used by you.

A *[bow spirit]* occupies your space, and moves with you.
It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but *[dispel magic]*,
*[disintegrate]*, a
*sphere of annihilation*, or a *[rod of cancellation]* affects
it. A *[bow spirit]*'s AC against touch attacks is 10 +

characters onto a creature, inflicting 1 point of damage. The mark may

points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily.
In addition, a *[greater brand]* blazes as bright as a
torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith.
While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened. Like the effects
of *[bestow curse]*, a
*[greater brand]* cannot be dispelled, but it can be
removed by any means that removes a *[mark of justice]*.



## Break


**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a twig)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one Medium or smaller object

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes
(object)

You can attempt to break or at least damage any one Medium or smaller
object within range. If the target fails its Fortitude saving throw, it
gains the broken condition. If cast on a broken item, that item is
destroyed on a failed save.



## Brilliant Inspiration


**School** evocation [language-dependent]; **Level** bard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round/level and special (see below)

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You open a link between your mind and the subject's mind, giving advice
and encouragement for as long as the spell is in effect. Each time the
subject of the spell makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill
check, it rolls two d20s and takes the better result. If any roll is a
natural 20, the spell's effect ends—your brilliant advice is spent.



## Bristle


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes

You give a creature the ability to redirect a portion of its innate
toughness away from its own defense and toward the amount of damage it
deals with natural attacks. Each round, as a swift action at the start
of its turn, the creature can choose to reduce some or all of its
natural armor bonus to AC and gain an enhancement bonus on all damage
rolls for natural attacks equal to that amount. The reduction to natural
armor, and thus the enhancement bonus on damage rolls, cannot exceed 1
point per 3 caster levels, to a maximum penalty/bonus of -5/+5 at 15th
level. A creature cannot reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0
with this spell. All attacks directed against the creature use its
adjusted AC until the start of its next turn, at which time it can
choose to modify its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures
make this decision without any need for conscious thought or reflection;
even creatures with no Intelligence score can benefit from this spell,
although they always opt for the maximum possible reduction and bonus,
regardless of any tactical advantage they might lose.



## Burning Gaze


**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch
2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (eye of a mundane salamander)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (see text); **Spell Resistance** yes

Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes
alight with a glance.

As a standard action as long as this spell's effects persist, you may
direct your *[burning gaze]* against a single creature or
object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed
at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended
objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a
Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a
Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points
of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or
take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already
on fire, it suffers no additional effects from *[burning gaze]*.

Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack—foes and
allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your
gaze.



## Burst Bonds


**School** evocation; **Level** inquisitor 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** touch

**Target** one object or creature restraining you

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude half (object); **Spell Resistance** yes

You blast your restraints with divine wrath, dealing 1d6 points of
damage per caster level to the target object (maximum 5d6), ignoring
hardness of 10 or less. A Fortitude save halves the damage, although
only magical restraints receive a saving throw.

You can also target a creature that is grappling or otherwise
restraining you (such as by adhesive or the swallow whole ability) with
the spell. You don't need to make a touch attack to use *[burst bonds]* against a creature, and you can cast this spell
without making a concentration check while grappled or pinned. The
creature does not take damage as above. If you are grappled and your
target fails its save, you may make an immediate attempt to break the
grapple (but not reverse it) as a free action, with a +1 luck bonus to
your CMB per caster level (maximum +5). If the target creature fails its
save and you are restrained by an ability that originally allowed a
saving throw, *[burst bonds]* allows a new saving throw
with a +1 luck bonus per two caster levels (maximum +5).



## Cacophonous Call


**School**enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a scrap of sheet music)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You fill your target's mind with a blaring cacophony of discordant
sounds, making it hard for the target to act and concentrate. The
creature gains the nauseated condition for the duration of the spell if


## it fails its Will save.


**School**enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 5

**Target** one creature/level (all of which must be within 30 feet)

This spell functions as *[cacophonous call]*, except
that it affects multiple creatures.



## Calcific Touch


**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature or creatures touched (up to one per level)

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch
into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts
1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1
round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the
ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified
permanently. *[Break enchantment]*,
*[restoration]*, or *[stone
to flesh]* can reverse
the effects of *[calcific touch]*.



## Call Animal


**School**enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**druid 1,
ranger 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, DF

**Range**see description

**Effect** one animal whose CR is equal or less than your caster level

**Duration**1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance**none

This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you
designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster
level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power,
so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the
desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that
type capable of reaching you within the spell's duration, you are aware
of this fact, but the spell is wasted.
[Knowledge] of the local fauna
makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a
[Knowledge] (nature) skill check
(DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.

When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you
and remains nearby for the duration of the spell. Its starting attitude
is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than
starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability
to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells
or abilities to do so.

Once the spell's duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with
its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile
predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.

Domesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such
creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by *call
animals*.



## Campfire Wall


**School** evocation [fire, light]; **Level** bard 3, druid 2, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (ash made from burnt thorns)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** 20-ft.-radius sphere centered on fire source

**Duration** 2 hours/level; see below (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You can create a barrier around a fire of at least campfire size that
shelters everyone inside so long as the fire continues to burn. The
barrier appears as a crackling sphere of light and fire that is clearly
visible, providing as much illumination as a torch. The barrier bocks
line of sight, granting creatures on either side of the barrier total
concealment from creatures on the other side. Any object or creature
passing through the barrier from outside takes 1d6 points of fire damage
and is also outlined with light equivalent to that of a torch, for 1d6
minutes. Creatures outlined in this way are plainly visible regardless
of the light conditions and do not benefit from any sort of concealment,
magical or otherwise. The light is not bright enough to have any special
effect on undead or creatures vulnerable to light. Creatures inside the
barrier can leave without penalty, but if they try to return they suffer
the same consequences as anyone else. If the fire source at the
barrier's center is extinguished or moved, the spell ends.



## Castigate


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [fear, language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** inquisitor 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 round; see text

**Saving Throw** Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You compel the target to beg for forgiveness. On a failed save, the
target cowers with fear. On a successful save, it is shaken for 1 round.
Each round on its turn, a cowering subject may attempt a new save to end
the effect. A creature who worships the same god as you takes a -2


## penalty on its saving throw.


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [fear, language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** inquisitor 5

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

This spell functions as *[castigate]*, except it affects
many creatures.



## Cast Out


**School** abjuration; **Level** inquisitor 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any
magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point
per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check
against any *[magic jar]* effect
(including a ghost's malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion)
spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells
and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted *[dispel magic]* spell, except
*[cast out]* can dispel one such spell for every four caster
levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits
the dispelling to a single spell or effect.



## Challenge Evil


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** paladin
1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one evil creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You challenge an evil creature to bring the fight to you, or suffer the
consequences. You gain a +2 sacred bonus on all melee attacks against
the subject of the spell. At the end of its turn, if the target has not
made at least one attack on you, it becomes sickened. If you move away
from the target, the spell ends.



## Chameleon Stride


**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level

You fade into the background, and while you are not truly invisible, you
are hard to pinpoint due to your translucent state. While under the
effects of this spell, you gain a +4 bonus on
[Stealth] checks and have
concealment from creatures more than 5 feet away (attacks have a 20%
miss chance).



## Clashing Rocks


**School** conjuration (creation) [earth]; **Level** druid 9,
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Reflex partial, see text; **Spell Resistance** no

You create two Colossal-sized masses of rock, dirt, and stone and slam
them together against a single creature between them. The *[clashing rocks]* appear up to 30 feet away from the target on
opposite sides and rush toward it with a mighty grinding crash. You must
make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with the rocks. The
*[clashing rocks]* ignore concealment and cover, and if
there is a solid barrier between the target and either of the *[clashing rocks]*, the spell has a +28 bonus on the Strength
check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded to the target.
A creature struck by the *[clashing rocks]* takes 20d6
points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the target fails a
Reflex saving throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if
by a cave-in (see *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook* 415).

If the *[clashing rocks]* miss the target, the target
still takes 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage from falling rocks and is
knocked prone. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage to half and
the target remains standing. Creatures other than the target that occupy
the spaces where the *[clashing rocks]* appear or
within their path (30 feet wide, 30 feet high, and up to 60 feet long)
must also make Reflex saves or take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage
and be knocked prone (save for half and remain standing). A creature can
only take damage once from the *[clashing rocks]*, no
matter how many times the *[clashing rocks]* pass over
a target creature.



## Cleanse


**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 5, inquisitor 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

Positive energy infuses and cleanses your body. This spell cures 4d8
points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) and ends any
and all of the following adverse conditions affecting you: ability
damage, blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted,
fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, and sickened. In addition,
*[cleanse]* functions as *[break enchantment]*
upon a single additional effect of your choice that is affecting you and
that can be legally affected by this effect.

If used by undead or other creatures healed by negative energy, the
spell cleanses with negative energy rather than positive.



## Cloak of Dreams


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 5,
sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (a rose petal and a drop of perfume)

**Range** 5 ft.

**Area** 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You are surrounded by a soporific aroma that causes living creatures
that begin their turn or end their movement within 5 feet of you to fall
asleep for 1 minute. Creatures must save each time they begin their turn
or end their movement within the *[cloak of dreams]*,
even if they have previously saved against the effect. Sleeping
creatures are helpless but can be awakened with a standard action or
after being wounded. Creatures with the scent special quality have a -4
penalty on their saves.



## Cloak of Shade


**School**abjuration; **Level**druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, M (a leaf from a shade tree)

**Range**touch

**Target**one creature per level

**Duration**1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance**yes
(harmless)

This spell provides the subject with some degree of protection from the
harmful effects of the sun. The cloaked subject treats environmental
heat due to sun exposure as one level less: severe heat is considered
very hot conditions, while very hot is considered average temperature
(see [heat dangers]). The *[cloak
of shade]* also reduces any penalties from sunlight by
1. The spell does not, however, eliminate the effects of direct sunlight
on creatures vulnerable to sunlight. *[Cloak of shade]*
has no effect on environmental heat from sources other than the sun.



## Cloak of Winds


**School** abjuration [air]; **Level** druid 3, ranger 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind. The
subject is never checked or blown away by strong winds of windstorm or
lesser strength (whether natural or magically created), and ranged
attack rolls against the subject take a -4 penalty. Tiny or smaller
creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save to successfully touch or
attack the subject in melee. Failure knocks the attacker prone and
pushes it 5 feet away from the subject per level of the caster. This
movement can pass through the squares of other creatures without
affecting them and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but the
creature takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature
strikes a solid object that blocks its movement.



## Confess


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** inquisitor 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** Will partial; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You ask the target creature a single question. On the subject's next
action, it must answer truthfully in the same language as the question
or take 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) and be
sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save negates the sickening
effect and halves the damage. A creature that is unable to answer still
takes damage.



## Contagious Flame


**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** three or more rays

**Duration** 3 rounds

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You blast several enemies with beams of fire. You may fire three rays,
plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 11th (to a maximum
of five rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to
hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the
same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within
30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

Every round on your turn, a new ray of fire launches from each creature
who took damage from the spell in the previous round—these new rays
attack as if you fired them, but their point of origin is the previous
creature damaged. You can choose the new targets as a free action, all
of whom must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of their
new starting point. This contagion of flame continues for a total of
three rounds—a creature can be struck more than once by this spell over
the course of these three rounds, although never by a ray of fire that
launches from itself.



## Coordinated Effort


**School** divination; **Level** bard 3, inquisitor 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** you plus one willing creature per 3 levels, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. part

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

Choose a single teamwork feat that you possess. You forge a link with
your allies, allowing them to gain the benefits of the chosen feat even
if they do not have it themselves. You must be a part of the group
qualifying for a given bonus for your allies to gain the benefits. For
example, two of your allies flanking an orc would gain no benefit from
your Outflank feat, but an ally flanking the orc with you would. Your
allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed
in the teamwork feat for either of you to receive the listed bonus.



## Corruption Resistance


**School** abjuration [chaotic, evil, good, or lawful]; **Level**
antipaladin 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical effects
that inflict damage based on the target creature's alignment, such as
*[holy smite]*, *[order's wrath]*, a paladin's smite
evil attack, or an *[unholy]*
weapon. Choose one alignment type: chaos, evil, good, or law. The
subject takes 5 less points of damage from effects that specifically
harm creatures of that alignment. The value of the protection increases
to 10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell
protects the recipient's equipment as well.

*[Corruption resistance]* protects against
spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities, not physical
attacks. *[Corruption resistance]* only protects
against damage. The subject can still suffer side effects from such
attacks. When you use this spell to protect an alignment, it gains the
descriptor of that alignment.



## Coward's Lament


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
inquisitor 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You compel an opponent to face you in combat, or suffer for its
cowardice. Each round that the target fails to attack you in melee, it
receives a cumulative -1 penalty to its Armor Class, attack rolls, and
saving throws (maximum penalty -5). Each round at the end of its turn,
the target may attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the penalties from
increasing for that round. All penalties reset to zero when the target
attacks you in melee, but increase again if it stops attacking. If the
target is prevented from attacking you by physical restraint, magic, or
impassable terrain, the penalties do not increase. If you move away from
the target, the spell ends.



## Crafter's Curse


**School**transmutation; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, M (a broken tool)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one creature

**Duration**1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance**yes

The target of *[crafter's curse]* takes a -5 penalty
on all [Craft] skill checks while the
spell lasts.



## Crafter's Fortune


**School**transmutation; **Level**alchemist 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, F (a tool)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one creature

**Duration**1 day/level or until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance**yes
(harmless)

The target is struck by inspiration and gains a +5 luck bonus on its
next [Craft] skill check.



## Create Pit


**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner
2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (miniature shovel costing 10 gp)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** 10-ft.-by-10-ft. hole, 10 ft. deep/2 levels

**Duration** 1 round + 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; **Spell Resistance** no

You create a 10-foot-by-10-foot extradimensional hole with a depth of 10
feet per two caster levels (maximum 30 feet). You must create the pit on
a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another
dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the
original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a
ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any
creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make
a Reflex saving throw to jump to safety in the nearest open space. In
addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its
turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw
with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an
effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get
a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing
effect.

Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The pit's
coarse stone walls have a [Climb] DC of
25. When the duration of the spell ends, creatures within the hole rise
up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface
over the course of a single round.



## Create Treasure Map


**School** divination; **Level** bard 2, druid 3, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 hour

**Components** V, S, M (powdered metal and rare inks worth 100 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** one dead creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You can take a piece from a dead creature's body and use it to create a
map that reveals the locations of any valuables that creature knew about
while still alive. You must cut this piece off yourself and the creature
cannot have died more than 24 hours prior to the casting of this spell.
You cannot cast this spell on a creature without a physical body, and
the portion you remove must have a fairly level surface such as a piece
of hide, carapace, or skin. The map you create is accurate to the best
knowledge the creature had at the time of its death. It reveals the
location of one source of treasure for every three caster levels you
possess. Any inaccuracies or faulty information held by the creature are
represented on the map as well. Similarly, the map cannot account for
any changes that occur after the creature's death. You must choose the
scale of the map when creating it, opting between nearby (e.g., one or
two dungeon levels), local (e.g., a valley or community), or broad
(e.g., a country or larger). The map reveals the locations of what the
creature deemed most valuable within its area. Depending on the
creature, the map might reveal a source of tasty food, suitable mates,
or even your own treasure vault.



## Cup of Dust


**School**transmutation; **Level**druid 3, witch 3

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, M (a pinch of dust)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one creature

**Duration**1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance**yes

You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed
saving throw, the target begins to
[dehydrate]. The effects
of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has
hit points. No amount of drinking can counter this effect, although the
target still experiences the other normal effects of any liquid imbibed
(such as poisons or potions). *[Cup of dust]*can be
removed with a *[break enchantment],
[limited wish],
[miracle], [remove curse],*or
*[wish]* spell, but effects suffered as a
result of dehydration must be healed by normal means.



## Dancing Lantern


**School** transmutation [fire, light]; **Level** bard 1, cleric 1,
ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a lantern)

**Range** touch

**Effect** animates one lantern

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You can animate a lantern and order it to follow you. The lantern floats
at shoulder height and remains within 5 feet of you, no matter how fast
you move. The lantern cannot support any additional weight. The lantern
illuminates its normal area, even if it does not have any oil in it. For
the purposes of spells or effects targeting it the lantern always acts
as if in your possession even when not directly on your person.
A*[dancing lantern]* can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]* spell (CL 9th,
2,500 gp).



## Deadly Finale


**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** 1 creature/3 levels no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a
flourish, you immediately end your performance, dealing 2d8 points of
sonic damage to each target. In addition, each target takes 3d6 points
of bleed damage for 1d6 rounds. A save negates the bleed damage but not
the sonic damage.



## Deafening Song Bolt


**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** up to 3 creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance** no

Three notes you sing or perform become tangible bolts of arcane energy
that shriek across the battlefield. Each bolt requires a ranged touch
attack to hit and deals 3d10 points of sonic damage, deafening the
target for 1d6 rounds. The bolts may be fired at the same or different
targets, but all must be fired simultaneously.



## Defile Armor


**School** abjuration [evil]; **Level** inquisitor 4, antipaladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** armor touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless, object); **Spell Resistance**
yes (harmless, object)

As *[sanctify armor]*, except you
gain DR 5/good when using your judgment or smite ability.



## Deflection


**School** abjuration [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of rubber dipped in glue)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

You surround yourself in a whirling barrier of force that sends any
attack that misses you hurling back toward its source. This applies to
any melee or ranged attack directed against you so long as it uses an
attack roll to determine whether or not it strikes you. If an attack
misses you, the attacker must make a second attack roll against its own
Armor Class, using all of the applicable modifiers of the original
attack and if it hits, the attacker takes the attack's damage and
suffers all the other consequences of getting struck with that attack.
You cannot deflect attacks that miss you for any reason besides a failed
attack roll (such as concealment). Similarly, you cannot deflect attacks
that actually do strike you but simply fail to do any harm.



## Delayed Consumption


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 day/level (D) or until discharged

When you consume this extract, you quickly consume another extract of
your choice—this second extract's effects do not come into effect until
a later point. You must consume this second, companion extract on the
round following *[delayed consumption]* or waste
the extract. The companion extract can be no higher than 4th level, and
you must pay any costs associated with the companion extract when you
consume it.

At any point during the duration of this extract, you can cause the
companion extract to take effect as an immediate action. You can only
have one *[delayed consumption]* in effect at one
time. If a second is consumed, the first is dispelled without any
effect.



## Denounce


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 4, inquisitor 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 30-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You speak out against a single creature within line of sight and turn
possible allies against it by drawing upon the power of your voice and
conviction. Creatures in the area who can see the denounced creature
must make a Will saving throw or have their [starting attitude] toward the denounced creature
worsened by two levels. For example, creatures previously indifferent to
the subject turn unfriendly.
[Diplomacy] checks made to
reverse the effects of *[denounce]* are made at a -10
penalty.



## Detect Aberration


**School**divination; **Level**druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S

**Range**long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area**cone-shaped emanation

**Duration**concentration, up to 10 minutes/level (D)

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance**no

This spell functions like *[detect animals or plants],*
except it detects creatures of the aberration type.



## Detonate


**School** evocation [acid, cold, electricity, or fire]; **Level**
alchemist 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (two vials; one containing acid and one
containing an alkaline solution worth a total of 50 gp)

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** 30-ft.-radius spread centered on you

**Duration** 1 round, then instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

You flood yourself with a potent surge of elemental energy. One round
after completing the casting of the spell, the energy explodes from your
body.

When this spell creates the explosion of energy, choose one of the
following four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The
explosion inflicts 1d8 points of damage of that energy type per caster
level (maximum 10d8) to all creatures and unattended objects within 15
feet, and half that amount to targets past 15 feet but within 30 feet.
You automatically take half damage from the explosion, without a saving
throw, but any other energy resistance or energy immunity effects you
may have in place can prevent or lessen this overflow damage caused by
the explosion.



## Devolution


**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a chameleon scale)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one eidolon

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

This spell causes an eidolon to lose one evolution plus one additional
evolution for every five caster levels. Evolutions with the highest
total cost are lost first. If there is a tie, randomly determine which
is lost. If this spell causes an eidolon to fail to meet the
prerequisites for other evolutions or abilities, those evolutions or
abilities are lost as long as this spell persists.



## Discordant Blast


**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 10 ft. or 30 ft.

**Area** see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot-radius burst
centered on you or in 30-foot cone-shaped burst. Creatures in the area
take 3d6 points of sonic damage and are pushed away as if bull rushed.
Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature in
the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus
your Charisma modifier. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. A *[discordant blast]* cannot penetrate
a *[silence]* spell (or any similar
magical silence effect).



## Divine Transfer


**School**necromancy; **Level** paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous + 1 round/level (see text)

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

With a single touch, you transfer some of your life essence to the
subject, transferring your hit points and your resolve. When you touch
the subject you can transfer up to a number of hit points equal to your
Constitution score to the target. These hit points heal the subject, but
cannot raise the subject's hit points higher than its normal hit point
total. In addition, the subject gains DR/evil equal to your Charisma
bonus (if any) for the duration of the spell.



## Divine Vessel


**School** transmutation [chaotic, evil, good, or lawful]; **Level**
oracle 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

You accept otherworldly energies into your body and transform. Your size
increases by one category, your height doubles, and your weight
increases by a factor of eight. Your features shift into those of a cold
and alien being of logic, a creature of primal chaos, an angelic
presence, or a fiendish monster, as chosen by you. You gain a +6 size
bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3 natural armor bonus, darkvision
60 ft., and SR of 12 + your caster level. These modifiers replace the
normal modifiers for increasing your size. The size modifier for AC,
attacks, CMB, and CMD changes as appropriate for your new size category.
This spell doesn't change your base speed. Determine space and reach as
appropriate for your new size.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the
maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your
increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail,
you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you—the
spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.

All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by this spell.
Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not
affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession
(including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its
normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their
normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.

You gain additional abilities as noted below.

**Anarchic aspect**: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2
bonus to Constitution, DR 10/lawful, resist acid 10, electricity 10, and
sonic 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, blindsense 30 feet, and a
fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain a bite attack
dealing 2d6 points of damage. Your natural weapons and any weapons you
wield are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage resistance.

**Axiomatic aspect**: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2
bonus to Strength, DR 10/chaotic, resist cold 10, electricity 10, and
fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly
speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing
1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you
wield are considered lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
resistance.

**Celestial aspect**: You gain the following abilities: a +2 bonus to
Dexterity, DR 10/evil, resist acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10, a +4
bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60
feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points
of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are
considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.

**Fiendish aspect**: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2
bonus to Strength, DR 10/good, resist acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, a
+4 bonus on saves against poison, see in darkness, and a fly speed of 60
feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 claw attacks dealing 1d6 points
of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are
considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.

When used to assume an anarchic, axiomatic, celestial, or fiendish
aspect, this spell is a chaotic, lawful, good, or evil spell
respectively.



## Draconic Reservoir


**School** evocation [acid, cold, electricity, or fire]; **Level**
alchemist 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a scale from dragon that produces the energy you
seek to absorb)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 minutes/level or until discharged; see text

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

*[Draconic reservoir]* functions as *[protection
from energy]*,
absorbing 6 points of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid,
cold, electricity, or fire, maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift
action, the subject can release 1d6 points of the absorbed energy and
apply it to any melee attack, as if using an *acidic*,
*[flaming]*,
*[frost]*, or
*[shock]* weapon. The
first creature the subject strikes with this attack takes the energy
damage in addition to any other consequences of the attack. Releasing
energy in this way does not “free up” space to absorb still more energy;
the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed. The
subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once
the subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes
damage as normal from that energy type. Once the energy has been
released, the spell is discharged.

*[Draconic reservoir]* does not stack with
*[protection from energy]*.
*[Draconic reservoir]* overlaps (and does not
stack with) *[resist energy]*. If a character
is warded by *[draconic reservoir]* and *[resist energy]*, *[draconic reservoir]* absorbs damage until it reaches its
maximum limit.



## Dragon's Breath


**School**evocation [acid, cold, electricity, or fire];
**Level**alchemist 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, M (a dragon scale)

**Range**30 ft. or 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst or line

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Reflex half; **Spell Resistance**yes

You breathe out a blast of energy. Creatures in the affected area take
1d6 points of energy damage per caster level (maximum of 12d6). A
successful Reflex save results in half damage. The spell's effect and
energy type depend on the type of dragon scale used:

*Black dragon:* 60-foot line of acid.

*Blue or bronze dragon:* 60-foot line of electricity.

*Green dragon:* 30-foot cone of acid.

*Gold or red dragon:* 30-foot cone of fire.

*Silver or white dragon:* 30-foot cone of cold.

*Brass dragon:* 60-foot line of fire.

*Copper dragon:* 60-foot line of acid.



## Dust of Twilight


**School** conjuration [darkness]; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (coal dust)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** creatures and objects in a 10-ft. spread

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (fatigue only); **Spell Resistance**
no

A shower of iridescent black particles clings to and extinguishes
torches, lanterns, sunrods, and similar mundane light sources and
dispels any spell of 2nd level or lower with the light descriptor (as
*[dispel magic]*).
Creatures in the area must make a Fortitude save or become fatigued.



## Eagle Eye


**School**divination; **Level**druid 2, ranger 2

**Casting Time**1 minute

**Component**V, S, DF

**Range**long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** magical sensor

**Duration**1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance**no

*[Eagle eye]*creates a magical sensor directly above you.
The sensor can appear anywhere above you, to a maximum height equal to
the spell's range. You can see from this vantage as if you were actually
there, rotating your viewpoint 360 degrees. You perceive with your
normal visual senses. A caster using *[eagle eye]* can
easily see for a considerable distance. The spell does not penetrate any
solid surface, although it is unaffected by foliage and the like.



## Elemental Aura


**School** evocation [acid, cold, electricity, or fire]; **Level**
alchemist 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

This spell forms an aura of energy around you, damaging all those that
come near you. Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.
Creatures adjacent to you when this spell is cast and at the start of
your turn take 2d6 points of energy damage of the selected type. This
aura has an additional effect, depending upon the type of energy chosen.

**Acid**: Creatures affected by your aura take 1 point of ongoing acid
damage per round for 1 round per three caster levels, and are sickened
for the duration of the ongoing acid damage.

**Cold**: Creatures affected by your aura are fatigued. A creature that
is already fatigued suffers no additional effect.

**Electricity**: Creatures affected by your aura are staggered for 1
round.

**Fire**: Creatures affected by your aura catch on fire (*Core Rulebook*
444).

Creatures adjacent to you are allowed a Reflex save to halve the damage
and negate the additional effect. The aura's additional effects do not
stack if a creature takes damage from your aura multiple times. You may
only have one *[elemental aura]* in effect at one time.
When you cast this spell to deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire
damage, it is a spell of that type.



## Elemental Speech


**School** divination [air, earth, fire, or water]; **Level** bard 3,
cleric 3, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (iron filings)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level

This spell enables you to converse with creatures associated with a
chosen element, including but not limited to true elemental creatures.
This spell gains the elemental subtype based on the version of the spell
you cast. *[Elemental speech]* does not guarantee a
friendly reaction; it merely enables communication. You may converse
with all creatures of the selected type with an Intelligence score of 1
or greater, even if they do not understand one another.

When cast as an air spell, you can converse in Auran and with any
creature that has the air subtype or a fly speed.

When cast as an earth spell, you can converse in Terran and with any
creature that has the earth subtype or a burrow speed.

When cast as a fire spell, you can converse in Ignan and with any
creature that has the fire subtype.

When cast as a water spell, you can converse in Aquan and with any
creature that has the water subtype or a swim speed.



## Elemental Touch


**School** evocation [acid, cold, electricity, or fire]; **Level**
alchemist 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a bit of the chosen element: earth, water, air,
or fire)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **Spell Resistance** no

Upon completing the casting of this spell, elemental energy infuses your
hands. Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain
a melee touch attack causing 1d6 points of damage of that energy type,
along with a special effect described below. You also deal energy damage
and the related special effect when you attack with your hands using an
unarmed strike, a single claw, or a single slam attack. This bonus
damage can never apply to multiple weapons.

**Acid**: Your touch attack causes 1 point of ongoing acid damage per
round for 1 round per three caster levels. The target must make a
Fortitude save or be sickened for the duration of the ongoing acid
damage.

**Cold**: The target must make a Fortitude save or be fatigued. A
creature that is already fatigued suffers no additional effect.

**Electricity**: The target must make a Fortitude save or be staggered
for 1 round.

**Fire**: Your hands ignite and shed light as a torch. Your touch may
cause targets to catch on fire (*Core Rulebook* 444).

Subsequent attacks inflict the normal damage, but the additional effects
do not stack. This spell grants no special protection to anything held
in or worn on your hands. When you cast this spell to deal acid, cold,
electricity, or fire damage, it is a spell of that type.



## Elude Time


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (powdered diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire
dust worth 500 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** up to 1 minute/level; see text

You place yourself in a state of suspended animation, similar to
*[temporal stasis]*.
At the time of casting, you choose when the stasis will expire, up to
the maximum duration of the spell. Until the duration ends, time ceases
to flow for you, and all bodily functions cease. No force or effect can
harm you until the spell expires or is removed, such as by a successful
*[dispel magic]* spell.



## Enemy Hammer


**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (puppet strings)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby
opponents or objects. You must target a specific creature when casting
this spell and once you select that creature you cannot switch to
another. Each round, as a standard action, you can attempt to hurl the
target at any creature or object within 30 feet of it. You must make an
attack roll whenever you use the target as a weapon. The attack bonus
for this attack is equal to your caster level plus either your
Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). If you
successfully hit the new target with the creature both it and the
creature take damage based on the creature's size.

**Creature Size Damage Dealt**

  Creature Size   Damage Dealt
  --------------- --------------
  Fine            1d4
  Diminutive      1d6
  Tiny            1d8
  Small           1d10
  Medium          2d6
  Large           2d8
  Huge            2d10
  Gargantuan      3d6
  Colossal        3d8

The target creature can make a Fortitude saving throw each time you
attempt to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving throw it can act
normally, but if it fails its save it loses all actions for the round
and ends its turn prone in a square adjacent to the target of your
attack. However, if the creature chooses to resist your efforts to move
it, taking no other actions for the round, it gets a +4 circumstance
bonus on its saving throw. The spell ends immediately if the target
creature dies or is destroyed.



## Enter Image


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a drop of paint and a ball of clay)

**Range** 50 ft./level

**Effect** transfer consciousness to any object bearing your likeness

**Duration** concentration

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You gain a dim impression of the activities around any object bearing
your face or form and can also project your consciousness into one such
object at a time, allowing you to observe or even interact with nearby
creatures. This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously
monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether
one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of
your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a
[Perception] check to notice
anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater
than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so
even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as
talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10
[Perception] check to notice
it.

You may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range
with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to
monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own
body's surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always
failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image,
but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.

When you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form
of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can
move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave
their square without assistance. Portraits or similar two-dimensional
representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can
move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as
by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other
abilities while within an image.

You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once
your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it
immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If
someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed.
The spell lasts until you cease concentrating, or until it is terminated
by some outside means, such as a *[dispel magic]* cast upon either
the image or your body, or if your body is killed.



## Euphoric Tranquility


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 6,
cleric 8, druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a poppy flower)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none and Will partial (see below); **Spell Resistance**
yes

A creature under the effect of this enchantment enters a state of
euphoria. The target treats all creatures as dear friends and abhors
violence, but may rise up to protect itself if violence is perpetrated
against it. Until the end of the spell's duration, the creature's speed
is halved, and it cannot make attacks or cast spells. If the creature is
attacked, it gets a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the
creature can make act normally for 1 round. If the saving throw fails,
the creature moves half its speed away from the attacker as its next
action.

Furthermore, if the creature is interacted with, or questioned while
under the effects of this spell, it is considered to have an attitude of
Helpful (see the [Diplomacy]
skill, *Core Rulebook* 94), though any advice or answers it gives may be
disjointed or stream of consciousness due to its euphoric state.



## Evolution Surge


**School** transmutation; **Level** summoner 3

This spell functions as *[lesser evolution surge]*, except that you can grant any


## evolution whose total cost does not exceed 4 evolution points.


**School** transmutation; **Level** summoner 4

This spell functions as *[lesser evolution surge]*, except that you can grant any two


## evolutions whose total cost does not exceed 6 evolution points.


**School** transmutation; **Level** summoner 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a chameleon scale)

**Range** touch

**Target** your eidolon

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** no

This spell causes your eidolon to take on new characteristics. You can
grant the eidolon any evolution whose total cost does not exceed 2
evolution points. You may only grant one evolution with this spell, even
if that evolution can be taken multiple times. You can grant an
evolution that allows you to spend additional evolution points to
upgrade that evolution. This spell cannot be used to grant an upgrade to
an evolution that the eidolon already possesses. The eidolon must meet
any prerequisites of the selected evolution. This spell does not allow
an eidolon to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks.



## Expeditious Excavation


**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (tiny shovel)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** dirt in a 5-ft. cube

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **Spell Resistance** no

You can excavate and move earth, dust, and sand up to the size of a
5-foot cube. If you are buried, you may open a 5-foot cube around
yourself, but the spell cannot be used for tunneling. Besides its
mundane applications, you can open a 5-foot-deep pit at a creature's
feet. A Medium or smaller creature falls prone in the pit unless it
succeeds on a Reflex save. With a successful save, it can choose to land
harmlessly on its feet in the pit or hop to an adjacent square; this
movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can escape
a 5-foot-deep pit with a DC 5 [Climb]
check. Larger creatures may ignore pits smaller than their size.

The earth excavated by this spell is ordinarily distributed harmlessly
across the spell's range, but you may choose to throw up a burst of grit
and debris when you dig a pit. This cloud of debris provides concealment
to any creatures in the square affected and all adjacent squares for 1
round. *[Expeditious excavation]* has no effect
on solid rock or earth creatures.



## Expend


**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (miniature broken hourglass)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You cause all creatures in the affected area to use up one or more of
their limited-use magical abilities without any actual effect. A
limited-use magical ability is any supernatural or spell-like ability
which a creature can only activate a certain number of times during a
set interval (3/day, 1/hour, etc.). The spell does not affect abilities
which the creature can use at will or which are constant. It also does
not apply to magical items or anything else external to a creature. A
creature in the spell's area must make a Will saving throw or expend a
single use of one of its abilities. Abilities with the greatest number
of uses per day are affected first; if more than one ability has the
same number of uses, randomly determine which one is affected first.
Creatures must continue making Will saves, expending an additional use
of an ability for each failed save, until they succeed, at which point
the spell has no further effect.



## Feast of Ashes


**School**transmutation; **Level**druid 2, witch 2

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, M (a pinch of ash)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft/2 levels)

**Target**one creature

**Duration**2 days/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance**yes

You curse the target with a hunger no food can assuage. On a failed
saving throw, the target begins to
[starve]. The effects of
this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit
points. No amount of eating can counter the effect and, further, even
attempting to eat causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round
unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still experiences
the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or
potions). *[Feast of ashes]* can be removed with a
*[break enchantment],
[limited wish],
[miracle], [remove curse],*or
*[wish]* spell, but effects suffered as a
result of starvation must be healed by normal means.



## Feather Step


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 1, druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes

For the duration of this spell, the subject ignores the adverse movement
effects of difficult terrain, and can even take 5-foot steps in


## difficult terrain.


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 3, druid 3, ranger 3

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

As *[feather step]*, except this spell affects multiple
creatures.



## Fester


**School** necromancy; **Level** inquisitor 3, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (rotted meat)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 round; see text

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

Necrotic energy permeates the target, blocking healing abilities. The
subject gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level against
effects that restore hit points or grant temporary hit points. In
addition, any healing provided by effects that ignore spell resistance
(such as fast healing, regeneration, and some spells) are halved. If the
target succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw, *[fester]* lasts


## only a single round.


**School** necromancy; **Level** inquisitor 6, witch 6

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

This spell functions as *[fester]*, except that it affects
multiple foes.



## Fiery Body


**School** transmutation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level

This spell transforms your body into living flame. You and your
equipment are immune to fire damage. In fact, every time you would
normally take damage from fire, you are instead healed of damage at a
rate of 1 point per 3 points of damage the fire attack would have
normally inflicted. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability
score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison,
stunning, and all spells that affect your physiology or respiration. You
take only half damage from acid or electricity. You take 150% as much
damage from cold than normal.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score and a fly speed
of 40 ft. (perfect maneuverability). Your unarmed attack deals an
additional 3d6 points of fire damage, and you are considered armed when
making unarmed attacks. Your body burns so brightly that creatures who
do not avert their gaze from you are dazzled. Fire spells you cast have
their save DCs increased by +1. If you enter water, you are surrounded
by a 5-foot radius of steam and bubbles that grant you concealment (50%
miss chance) but you take 2d6 points of damage each round you remain in
water.



## Firebrand


**School** transmutation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/4 levels, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless), but see below; **Spell
Resistance** yes (harmless)

You mark several allies with a flaming rune. This rune does not cause
damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the
*[firebrand]* burns, any creature it marks is immune to
damage from any fire spell you cast. All of the target's weapons (both
natural and manufactured) inflict +1d6 points of fire damage on a hit
(this bonus fire damage stacks with any amount of fire damage a
creature's weapons might already inflict). At any point during the
spell's duration, a creature bearing a *[firebrand]* can
launch a beam of fire at any target within 30 feet as a swift action.
This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 6d6 points of
fire damage. Once a creature uses its *[firebrand]* to fire
a ray in this manner, the effects of the spell end for that creature.



## Fire Breath


**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** alchemist 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a chili pepper)

**Range** 15 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** 1 round/level or until discharged; see text

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

Up to thrice during this spell's duration, you can belch forth a cone of
fire as a standard action. The first cone deals 4d6 points of fire
damage to every creature in the area. The second cone of flame deals 2d6
points of fire damage to every creature in the area. The third cone of
flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. A
successful Reflex save halves this damage. After the third cone of
flame, the spell ends.



## Firefall


**School** transmutation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (one fire source)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** one fire source, up to a 20-foot cube

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates and Reflex negates; see text; **Spell
Resistance** no

*[Firefall]*causes a fire to erupt into a geyser of
dazzlingly bright liquid flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is
immediately extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-foot cube is only
partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature
of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point of damage per
caster level (no saving throw).

The coruscating rain of fire fills a hemispherical burst with a radius
of 60 feet. All creatures and objects in the area take 5d6 points of
fire damage and catch on fire (*Core Rulebook* 444). Creatures who make
successful Reflex saves take half damage and don't catch on fire.
Creatures within 120 feet of the original fire source are blinded for
1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).



## Fire of Entanglement


**School** evocation; **Level** paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V, S

**Range** special; see text

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Reflex partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

The next creature you attack using your smite evil class ability is
wreathed in flames that impede its movement. Until the end of the
spell's duration, the target is entangled. If the target starts its turn
in a square adjacent to you, it is considered to be entangled to an
immobile object (you) and cannot move. A target that saves against this
spell is affected for only 1 round.



## Fire of Judgment


**School** evocation; **Level** paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V, S

**Range** special; see text

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite
evil class ability is engulfed in flames of positive energy. At the
start of its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of damage, and takes an
additional 1d6 points of damage each time it attacks a creature other
than you. If the creature is an outsider with the evil subtype, an
evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature this damage increases to
1d10. With a successful saving throw, a creature is affected by this
spell for only 1 round. This damage is divine in nature and bypasses any
DR the creature possesses.



## Fire of Vengeance


**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V, S

**Range** special; see text

**Target** one creature

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance** no

After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite
evil class ability is engulfed in holy flames that flare up when the
target attacks someone other than you. If at any time during the
duration of your smite evil effect the target makes an attack that does
not include you, it takes 3d8 points of fire damage. Once triggered in
this manner, or when your smite evil ability expires, the spell ends.



## Fire Snake


**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a snake scale)

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create a sinuous line of flames that you may shape as desired. The
*[fire snake]* affects one 5-foot square per caster level,
and each square must be adjacent to the previous square, starting with
you. The *[fire snake]* may not extend beyond its maximum
range. Creatures in the path of the *[fire snake]* take 1d6
points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).



## Flames of the Faithful


**School** transmutation [fire]; **Level** inquisitor 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** touch

**Target** weapon touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (object, harmless); **Spell
Resistance** yes (object, harmless)

With a touch, you cause a glowing rune to appear on a single weapon,
granting that weapon the
*[flaming]* property
(and allowing it to cause an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a
successful hit). If you are using the judgment class feature, your
weapon gains the *[flaming burst]* property
instead. The spell functions only for weapons that you wield. If the
weapon leaves your hand for any reason, the spell effect ends. The
effects of this spell do not stack with any existing
*[flaming]* or *[flaming burst]* weapon
property that the target weapon may already possess.



## Flare Burst


**School**evocation (light); **Level**bard 1, druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect**10-ft.-radius burst of light

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance**yes

This spell functions as *[flare],*
except it affects all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst from the
target point.



## Fluid Form


**School** transmutation [water]; **Level** alchemist 4, sorcerer/wizard
6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S, M (a mixture of oil and water)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level

When you cast this spell, your body takes on a slick, oily appearance.
For the duration of this spell, your form can stretch and shift with
ease and becomes slightly transparent, as if you were composed of
liquid. This transparency is not enough to grant concealment. You gain
DR 10/slashing and your reach increases by 10 feet. In addition, you can
pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with
anything you were carrying at the time the spell was cast (except other
creatures). Finally, you can move through water with a swim speed of 60
feet and can breathe both water and air for the duration of this effect.
You are treated as if you had the water subtype while this spell is in
effect.



## Fly


**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a wing feather)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

This spell functions as *[fly]* (*Core Rulebook*
284), save that it can target numerous creatures and lasts longer.



## Foe to Friend


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 5

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V, S

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

Cast this spell when an enemy is about to make an attack against an
ally. The creature makes the attack against a valid target of your
choice instead or the attack is negated. In addition, the target is
considered an ally for determining flanking for 1 round.



## Follow Aura


**School** divination [chaotic, evil, good, or lawful]; **Level**
inquisitor 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 minutes/level (D)

Choose one alignment type: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You gain the
ability to follow the trail of a strong or overwhelming aura of that
alignment (see *[detect evil]*, *Core Rulebook* 266).
This is treated as tracking using the scent special quality, except you
are following the traces of their aura upon the ground rather than their
scent, and you receive no bonus on
[Perception] checks. At 10th
level, you can track the trail of creatures with a moderate alignment
aura as well.

When you use this spell to track a given alignment, it gains the
descriptor of the opposite alignment. For example, when *[follow aura]* is used to track evil, it gains the good
descriptor.



## Fool's Forbiddance


**School** abjuration [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a ring of keys)

**Range** 10 ft.

**Area** 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation centered on you

**Duration** concentration

**Saving Throw**Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

Through your antics and performance, you create an area of warding that
adversely affects all enemies that dare enter it. When an enemy creature
enters the area it must make an immediate Will saving throw. If it
fails, the creature is confused as long as it is in the area and for 1
round after it leaves. If it succeeds on the saving throw, the creature
is staggered as long as it is in the area and for 1 round after it
leaves.



## Forced Repentance


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
inquisitor 4, paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one evil creature without the evil subtype

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You force an evil creature that does not have the evil subtype to
momentarily reflect on its past actions and be overcome by grief and
conscience. The target immediately drops prone and begins to loudly
confess all of its sins and transgressions to the caster for the
duration of the spell. The spell immediately ends if you move out of
line of sight or if the target is attacked.



## Frozen Note


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; **Level**
bard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Area** 30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Target** any number of creatures within area

**Duration** concentration (up to 1 round/level); see text

**Saving Throw** Will partial; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You produce and sustain a single perfect musical note that holds nearby
creatures, friend as well as foe, utterly spellbound until you stop
singing. Affected creatures are both paralyzed and oblivious to their
surroundings so long as you maintain the note. Maintaining this note
requires your absolute attention; if you take damage or take any other
action, including moving from your current square, the spell instantly
ends. Creatures that succeed in their initial saving throw must make a
new one for each round they spend within the area of the spell until
they fail and become captivated. Creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice
greater than your caster level are not affected by this spell. However,
those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive
a saving throw to resist it. The note is so clear and flawless that less
than extraordinary attempts to avoid hearing it merely grant targets a
bonus on their saving throws. Targets get a +2 circumstance bonus on
their saving throw for each barrier between your voice and their ears.
This includes such things as a creature stopping up its ears with wax,
closing all windows and doors in a nearby building, or even crawling
into a barrel and pulling down the top. If a target that had previously
made its saving throw loses the benefit of one or more of its barriers
it must immediately make a new saving throw. Similarly, any target that
had previously failed its saving throw gets a new save each time it
gains the protection of a barrier.



## Gallant Inspiration


**School** divination; **Level** bard 2

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes

This word of arcane-empowered inspiration often ensures success of a
crucial endeavor. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll
or skill check. The creature gains a +2d4 competence bonus to the attack
roll or skill check retroactively. If the bonus is enough to turn the
failure into a success, the roll succeeds.



## Getaway


**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** bard 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a brass doorknob)

**Range** unlimited

**Targets** you and one willing creature/2 levels, all of which must be
within 30 feet of you

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

*[Getaway]* teleports you and allies you designate at the
time of casting to a predetermined location. You must initially cast the
spell at that location—all creatures affected by the spell must be
present at that time and within 30 feet of you. At any time before the
spell's duration expires, you may trigger the spell as a swift action.
At this time, all affected creatures (or their remains and gear) within
30 feet of you are teleported to the location where you first cast the
spell. Creatures more than 30 feet away from you are left behind.
Selected creatures within 30 feet of you who do not wish to travel with
you at that time can simply choose not to go. You can be transported any
distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes.



## Geyser


**School** conjuration (creation) [fire, water]; **Level** druid 4,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a piece of lava rock)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** spout of boiling water filling a 5 ft. square and spraying
upward 10 ft./2 levels

**Duration** concentration + 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex partial (see below); **Spell Resistance** no

You cause a column of boiling water to spring forth from any horizontal
surface, knocking over creatures directly over it and exposing nearby
creatures to searing droplets as its spray falls back to the ground.

Any creature entering the *[geyser]*, or occupying the square
it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled
into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its
saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling water
and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the
*[geyser]* is 50 feet tall,
the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square
adjacent to the *[geyser]*. A successful saving throw halves
the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to
the closest square adjacent to the *[geyser]* (Large-sized or
larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the
geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks
of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement.

In addition, the *[geyser]* sprays boiling water in a
hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation
is equal to one-half the *[geyser]*'s height (e.g., a 50-foot
*[geyser]. Any creature
within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage
each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them.

You can choose to make a smaller *[geyser]* than your level
permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or
if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that's smaller
than what would be created by a full-height *[geyser]* spell.



## Ghostbane Dirge


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, cleric 2, inquisitor 2,
paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (an old reed from a wind instrument)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one incorporeal creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

The target coalesces into a semi-physical form for a short period of
time. While subject to the spell, the incorporeal creature takes half
damage (50%) from nonmagical attack forms, and full damage from magic


## weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects.


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 4, cleric 5, inquisitor 5,
paladin 3

**Target** one incorporeal creature/level, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions as *[ghostbane dirge]*, except
that it affects multiple targets.



## Glide


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard
2, summoner 2, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a leaf)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** until landing or 1 minute/level (D)

You take no damage from falls (as if from *[feather fall]*). In addition, you
can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot you
fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round. You cannot use this spell to
actually gain height, merely coast in other directions as you fall. If
subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes you to rise
you can take advantage of it in order to increase the distance you can
glide. The spell ends as soon as your feet touch the ground regardless
of its remaining duration. If the spell expires while you are still in
the air you fall the remaining distance as normal.



## Grace


**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 2, paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** see text

Until the end of your turn, your movement does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.



## Gravity Bow


**School** transmutation; **Level** ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

*[Gravity bow]* significantly increases the weight and
density of arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant
before they strike their target and then return them to normal a few
moments later. Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow you are carrying
when the spell is cast deals damage as if one size larger than it
actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from a Medium longbow normally
deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of
damage if fired from a *[gravity bow]*. Only you can
benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses your bow to make an attack
the arrows deal damage as normal for their size.



## Grove of Respite


**School**conjuration (creation); **Level**druid 4, ranger 4

**Casting Time**10 minutes

**Component**V, S, M/DF (a leaf or blade of grass and a drop of water)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** 20-ft.-radius grove

**Duration**2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance**no

You conjure a sheltered grove of trees surrounding a shallow spring. The
grove appears from nowhere even in the most barren, rocky soil
regardless of season, but the spell must be cast outside on open ground.

The area within the grove is temperate and comfortable, like that of a
*[tiny hut],* although the grove
provides no illumination and provides no protection from the elements.
The water in the grove's spring is clean and drinkable. Additionally,
the trees provide a variety of ripe fruit, regardless of season, which
acts as a *[goodberry]*spell for
up to eight people. The grove is warded with an
*[alarm]* spell that alerts you whenever
any creature enters the area. Once the spell expires, the grove
vanishes, including all fruit, water, and other materials from it,
although any nourishment or healing gained from its effects remains.



## Guiding Star


**School** divination; **Level** cleric 3, ranger 2, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a spool of thread or string)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

You form a bond with your surroundings when you cast this spell. For the
remaining duration of the spell you can always, as a standard action,
determine your approximate distance from that area as well as the
direction you must travel in order to reach it. You cannot determine the
location of the area if you are on a different plane. The area counts as
”very familiar” for the purposes of
*[teleport]* or similar spells.
You can only attune yourself to one location at a time. If you cast the
spell at another spot you lose the ability to locate your original area.



## Heroic Finale


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a
flourish, you immediately end the performance, and one creature within
range affected by your bardic performance can make a move action or a
standard action of their choice.



## Hero's Defiance


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

The instant before you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, you can
expend a use of your lay on hands ability to heal yourself as if you had
used lay on hands, plus an additional 1d6 hit points. If this healing
brings your hit point total above 0 hit points, you do not fall, and may
continue to act. If you have no more uses of lay on hands this spell has
no effect.



## Hidden Speech


**School** transmutation [language-dependent]; **Level** bard 2,
inquisitor 3, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a cipher written on a piece of parchment)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** you plus one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration** 10 minutes/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes

You greatly enhance the ability of the subjects to communicate hidden
messages to each other. Each target gains a +10 competence bonus on
[Bluff] checks to send secret message to
other recipients. Others using opposed [Sense Motive] checks to decipher
these messages receive a -5 penalty. All subjects affected by the spell
must share a language to be able to pass messages.



## Hide Campsite


**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** druid 3, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe, and a vial of quicksilver)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area**one 20-ft. cube

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Will disbelief (if interacted with); **Spell
Resistance** no

You make the area around a campsite appear to be a thicket of untouched
and forbidding foliage, or some other unwelcoming feature matching the
surrounding terrain. Creatures outside the area cannot sense any
activity going on inside the area—they cannot smell campfires or cooking
food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast,
and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area.
Those inside the area can see out normally. Once a creature steps into
the area of the spell, it can see everything in and around the area
normally.



## Holy Whisper


**School** evocation [good]; **Level** paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area**cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You whisper a single word in the primordial language of good that is
anathema to the minions of evil and strengthens the resolve of good
creatures. Evil creatures within the burst must make a Fortitude saving
throw or become sickened for 1 round/level. Evil outsiders with the evil
subtype, evil-aligned dragons, and undead in the burst also take 2d8
points of damage if they fail their saves. Good-aligned creatures in the
burst gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 round.



## Honeyed Tongue


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, M/DF (a drop of honey)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

This spell augments your diplomacies. While under the effects of spell,
you roll two dice each time you make a
[Diplomacy] check to change a
creature's attitude, taking the highest roll. If this results in a roll
low enough to reduce the creature's attitude by a step, that creature
gets some clue that you are manipulating it with a spell. Alternatively
you can cast this spell before making a
[Diplomacy] check to gather
information, gaining a +5 competence bonus on the check.



## Hungry Pit


**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner
5

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; Reflex half; see text; **Spell
Resistance** no

This spell functions as *[create pit]*,
except that the pit has the ability to squeeze and crush any creature
trapped within it and has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who
fall into the hole take falling damage as normal. In addition, anyone
within the pit, not just those on the bottom, takes 4d6 points of
bludgeoning damage each round as the pit contracts and then returns to
its normal size (a successful Reflex save halves this damage). The
ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult to scale and have a
[Climb] DC of 35.



## Hunter's Eye


**School** divination; **Level** inquisitor 3, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating
effects, *[hunter's eye]* greatly enhances your senses
against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target
when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the *[see invisibility]*
spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on
[Perception] checks to locate
the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist,
*[blur]*,
*[displacement]*,
*[invisibility]*, and
similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by
darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no
benefits against creatures other than the target.



## Hunter's Howl


**School** necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 20 ft.

**Area** 20-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** none

With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your opponents. Until the
end of the spell's duration, you treat those affected by it as if they
were your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage
rolls against them, and a +2 bonus on
[Bluff],
[Knowledge],
[Perception], [Sense Motive], and
[Survival] checks against them. If
an affected creature is already one of your favored enemies, it is
shaken instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.



## Hydraulic Push


**School** evocation [water]; **Level** druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature or object

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one
creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush
against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal
to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an
attack of opportunity. *[Hydraulic push]* extinguishes
any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square
which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected.



## Hydraulic Torrent


**School** evocation [water]; **Level** druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** 60-ft. line

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and
obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past.
Against creatures and moveable objects this stream acts as a bull rush.
You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger
than your own. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to
each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to
your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier,
whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of
opportunity.

Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you to make a
Strength check to destroy the target. When attempting to break an
object, the stream has an effective Strength equal to your caster level
plus the ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the
object you're trying to break—see [Breaking Items].

*[Hydraulic torrent]* extinguishes any normal fires
it encounters along its path. Magical fires are unaffected.



## Ill Omen


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** witch 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (hair from a black cat)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level or until discharged

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You afflict the target with bad luck. On the next d20 roll the target
makes, it must roll twice and take the less favorable result. For every
five caster levels you have, the target must roll twice on an additional
d20 roll (to a maximum of five rolls at 20th level).

A target who can speak and has at least one free hand and who is aware
of the spell and its effects (such as from a
[Spellcraft] check to identify
the spell as it is cast) can negate one reroll by spending a move action
to utter a brief prayer or good luck charm to appease the spirits of ill
fortune.



## Innocence


**School**transmutation; **Level**bard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 minute/level (D)

You surround yourself with an aura of innocence and trustworthiness. You
gain a +10 competence bonus on [Bluff]
skill checks to convince others of your innocence. They find it
difficult to believe you capable of any wrongdoing. This bonus does not
apply to other uses of the [Bluff]
skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or
communicating secret messages via innuendo, nor does it apply to any use
of the skill to convince anyone of anything other than your complete
innocence and blamelessness.



## Instant Armor


**School** conjuration (creation) [force]; **Level** cleric 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

You instantly wrap your body in a suit of armor made from opaque force.
At your option, the armor can be decorated with your religion's holy
symbol in a prominent place, such as upon the breastplate or helm. While
it exists, this armor replaces any garments or other sort of armor worn,
magical as well as mundane. You lose access to, and all benefits from,
armor replaced by this spell until the spell ends and the instant armor
disappears.

*[Instant armor]* acts in all ways as armor typical of
its type (armor bonus, maximum Dexterity bonus, arcane spell failure
chance, and so on). Since *[instant armor]* is made of
force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal
armor. The sort of armor you can create with this spell depends on your
caster level.

  Caster Level     Armor Created
  ---------------- ---------------
  5th or lower     chainmail
  6th-8th          banded mail
  9th-11th         half-plate
  12th or higher   full plate

If you choose to create lesser armor than your level allows you gain a
+1 magical enhancement bonus to the armor you do create for every type
of armor you pass over. For instance, if you have the capacity to create
full plate *[instant armor]* you could instead choose
to create *+1 half-plate*, *+2 banded mail*, or *+3 chainmail*. You
cannot replace these bonuses with armor special properties.



## Instant Enemy


**School**enchantment; **Level** ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature that is not your favored enemy.

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance** no

With this spell you designate the target as your favored enemy for the
remainder of its duration. Select one of your favored enemy types. For
the duration of the spell, you treat the target as if it were that type
of favored enemy for all purposes.



## Invigorate


**School**illusion [figment]; **Level**bard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V

**Range**touch

**Target**creature touched

**Duration**10 minutes/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance**yes
(harmless)

This spell banishes feelings of weariness. For the duration, the subject
takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. The effect
of *[invigorate]* is merely an illusion, however, not a
substitute for actual rest or respite. When the spell ends, the subject
takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, along with the return of the
original condition(s). A creature can be under the effects of only one
*[invigorate]* spell at a time; if it is cast a second time on that creature, the first effect immediately ends.


**School**illusion [figment]; **Level**bard 3

**Targets**creatures touched, up to one/level

This spell work as *[invigorate],* except it affects
multiple creatures.



## Jester's Jaunt


**School**conjuration (teleportation); **Level** bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantiations

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You teleport the target to a space you can see within 30 feet of the
target. The destination must be on solid ground, and the teleportation
cannot end in a space that is by nature hazardous to the creature you
are teleporting.



## Keen Senses


**School**transmutation; **Level**alchemist 1, druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, M/DF (a hawk's feather)

**Range**touch

**Target**creature touched

**Duration**1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance**yes
(harmless)

The subject gains a +2 competence bonus on
[Perception] checks and gains
low-light vision. Subjects that have low-light vision double the
distance they can see under the effects of this spell.



## King's Castle


**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

This spell allows you to switch places with an ally. When you cast this
spell, choose a single ally within range. You teleport to your ally's
space while your ally teleports to your former space.



## Knight's Calling


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** paladin
1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You compel an enemy to come and fight you. On its turn, the target moves
its speed toward you, avoiding any other dangers along its path
(including any movement that would provoke attacks of opportunity). The
target may do nothing but move on its turn. If the target ends its move
adjacent to you, you can make an attack of opportunity against the
target.



## Lead Blades


**School** transmutation; **Level** ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** touch

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

*[Lead blades]* increases the momentum and density of
your melee weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are
carrying when the spell is cast deal damage as if one size category
larger than they actually are. For instance, a Medium longsword normally
deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of
damage if benefiting from *[lead blades]*. Only you can
benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses one of your weapons to make
an attack it deals damage as normal for its size.



## Life Bubble


**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 5, druid 4, ranger 3,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a bit of eggshell)

**Range** touch

**Target** creatures touched, up to one/level

**Duration** 2 hours/level; see text

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You surround the touched creatures with a constant and moveable 1-inch
shell of tolerable living conditions. This shell enables the subjects to
breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making them
immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and
poisons and spells like
*[cloudkill]* and *[stinking cloud]*. In addition,
the shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per *[endure elements]*) as well
as extremes of pressure.

*[Life bubble]* does not provide protection from negative
or positive energy (such as found on the Negative and Positive Energy
planes), the ability to see in conditions of poor visibility (such as in
smoke or fog), nor the ability to move or act normally in conditions
that impede movement (such as underwater).

When you cast this spell it has a total duration of 2 hours per caster
level. You can divide this duration up in any manner you wish, not
necessarily equally, between up to 1 creature per caster level.



## Light Lance


**School** evocation [good, light]; **Level** paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Effect** lance of light

**Duration** 1 round + 1 round/level (D)

You create a glorious beam of brilliant radiance that acts as a *+1
[holy] lance* suitable for
your size. You must have a free hand when casting the spell and, once
you call the lance into being, you cannot switch it to another hand or
put it down without prematurely ending the spell. As a standard action
while holding a *[light lance]*, you can choose not to
make an attack and instead hold the lance aloft as a beacon of light and
truth, creating an area of bright light with a radius of 90 feet. If you
choose to do this for one or more additional rounds the lance also casts
a spear of brilliant light up into the sky that grows progressively more
visible as it continues to climb toward the heavens. Under cover of
night or other darkness, if nothing obstructs the beam, it becomes
visible for an additional 2 miles during each round in which you
continue to aim your lance skyward (2 miles in the second round, 4 miles
in the third round, and so on).



## Lily Pad Stride


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a frog's leg)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** trail of lily pads behind you

**Duration** 10 minutes/level (D); see text

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

Your every footstep creates aquatic plants capable of supporting your
weight and that of any creature of your size or smaller that is
following you. These lily pads only appear when you cross water or other
liquids which do not immediately destroy plants. You can walk across
these liquid surfaces without any fear of stumbling (though if knocked
prone, dragged under, or otherwise pulled off your feet you still sink
in the liquid). For the duration of the spell, any creature of your size
or smaller can attempt to follow you by making a DC 10
[Acrobatics] check every
round. Each such check allows it to move at half its normal land speed.
If the creature takes a -5 penalty on its check it can move at its
normal speed. If a creature fails an
[Acrobatics] check, or if a
creature that's larger than you attempts to follow, it falls through,
damaging the plants. Each time a creature falls through, all subsequent
creatures take a cumulative -5 penalty on their
[Acrobatics] checks when
traveling across that particular stretch of plants. As you move, the
lily pads disappear behind you once you pass beyond the spell's range.
Otherwise, they remain until the spell's duration expires.



## Lockjaw


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (sticky tree gum)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You give a creature the ability to use one of its natural attacks to
firmly attach itself to an opponent. Choose one of the creature's
natural attacks (usually a claw or bite attack). The creature gains the
grab ability with that natural attack, including the +4 bonus on combat
maneuver checks to start or maintain a grapple. A creature with multiple
natural attacks can strike at its grappled opponent with its other
natural attacks, but cannot attack any other creature.



## Marks Of Forbiddance


**School** abjuration [mind-affecting]; **Level** paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets**one enemy and one ally

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will negates; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

*Marks of
[Forbiddance]*magically
brand two creatures, preventing them from committing violence against
one another. When you cast this spell choose one enemy and one ally
within range. Both targets become branded with the sigil of forbiddance.
Until the end of the spell's duration, in order for the two targets to
attack one another, even with a targeted spell, each attacker must
attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, that target can attack the
other normally. If the save fails, the target can't follow through with
the attack and the action is lost. This spell does not prevent the
targets from attacking each other with area of effect spells or
abilities.



## Mask Dweomer


**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** witch 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of gauze)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature or object touched

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; see text; **Spell Resistance** no

You mask and manipulate a spell's magic aura to make it harder to
detect. Select one spell effect on the target creature or object. You
must have either cast this spell yourself or have perceived it by means
such as *[detect magic]* or
*[arcane sight]*. Both the
desired spell effect and *[mask dweomer]* are hidden from
*[detect magic]*, although
more powerful spells (such as *[arcane sight]*) pierce the
deception if the caster succeeds on a Will save. *[Analyze dweomer]*
automatically detects both *[mask dweomer]* and any
masked spell effects.



## Memory Lapse


**School** enchantment [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the
spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on
a [Diplomacy],
[Intimidate], or opposed skill
check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that
may be present.



## Moonstruck


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** druid 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered moonstone )

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one humanoid creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a
mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1
round, dropping held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen.
The target gains a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal damage
appropriate for the creature's size, and for the remainder of the
spell's duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous
*[rage]* and
*[confusion]* spells, attacking
with its natural weapons in preference to other actions. During the
final round of the spell's duration, the target is again dazed as it
returns to its normal state.



## Nap Stack


**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a little silk pillow worth 100 gp)

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** 30-ft.-radius emanation

**Duration** 8 hours

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You reduce the amount of uninterrupted sleep or rest creatures within
the spell's area need in order to recover from injuries, regain spells,
or other special abilities to 2 hours instead of the normal eight. In
addition, if creatures continue to sleep or rest beyond the initial 2
hours, every additional 2 hours counts as a day of rest for the purpose
of recovering hit points, ability damage, as well as for enduring
diseases, poisons, or other afflictions. This means 8 total hours of
sleep counts as 4 days for natural healing and for saving throws as
diseases or similar afflictions run their course. When suffering from
diseases, poison, or other afflictions, sleepers experience vivid dreams
that help them track their recovery. If things go poorly they can, at
any time, wake themselves up in order to seek a better alternative. If
awoken or otherwise disturbed during this 8-hour period, creatures may
return to sleep but they no longer enjoy the benefits of the accelerated
recovery time. Creatures can only enjoy the benefits of this spell once
in any 1-week period.



## Natural Rhythm


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a handful of pebbles dropped one by one onto the
ground)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You enhance a creature's ability to harm an opponent based on the number
of times it has already injured that opponent with a natural attack.
Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a natural
attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 bonus on damage rolls made
against that opponent when making natural attacks (maximum +5 bonus). If
an attack misses, the bonus to damage for all attacks resets to +0.



## Nature's Exile


**School**transmutation; **Level**druid 3, witch 3

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S, DF

**Range**touch

**Target**creature touched

**Duration**permanent

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance**yes

This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the
natural world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward
the target. Familiars, being magical beasts, are not affected by this
spell, but animal companions are. If you have an animal companion, it
does not become hostile, but as long as you remain cursed, your animal
companion takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and
saving throws. The target also takes a -10 penalty on
[Survival] skill checks as the
weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble.

*[Nature's exile]* can be removed with *[break enchantment]*,
*[limited wish]*,
*[miracle]*, *[remove curse]*, or
*[wish]*.



## Negate Aroma


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 1, druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a pinch of alum)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature or object/level touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

With a gesture, this spell allows you to dismiss even the foulest or
most distinctive scents. When cast, the targeted creatures or objects
lose all natural and unnatural odors. A creature under the effect of
*[negate aroma]* cannot be tracked, located, or
pinpointed by the scent special quality. In addition, this spell
prevents the target creature from using the stench special ability and
similar odor-based abilities (such as those possessed by troglodytes).

*[Negate aroma]* does not prevent the target from
acquiring outside smells or odors. Dowsing the creature with a pungent
substance effectively negates the benefits of the spell until the
substance is neutralized or washed away.



## Oath of Peace


**School** abjuration; **Level** paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

Entreating your deity for aid, you make a temporary oath of peace,
granting you superior defenses but means you can't attack for the
duration of the oath. For as long as you are subject to this spell, you
gain a +5 sacred bonus to AC and on saving throws, as well as DR
10/evil. If you make a direct or indirect attack or any show any
hostility toward any creature, the spell immediately ends.



## Oracle's Burden


**School** necromancy; **Level** oracle 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You entreat the forces of fate to bestow your oracle's curse upon
another creature. The target creature suffers all the hindrances and
none of the benefits of your oracle's curse class feature. You still
suffer all effects of your oracle's curse. If you do not have the
oracle's curse class feature, this spell has no effect.



## Pain Strike


**School**evocation [evil]; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one living creature

**Duration**1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance**yes

*[Pain strike]*racks the targeted creature with agony,
inflicting 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round for 1 round per
level (maximum 10 rounds). Additionally, the affected creature is
sickened for the spell's duration, and the caster gains a +4
circumstance bonus on
[Intimidate] checks against the target.


**School**evocation [evil]; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5

**Targets**one living creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

This spell works like *[pain strike],*except as noted
above.



## Paladin's Sacrifice


**School** abjuration; **Level** paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You open up a brief but powerful divine conduit between you and another
creature, taking on the damage and any other effects that creature
suffers. When a creature in range is hit by an attack or fails a saving
throw, you can cast this spell and the wounds and/or effects are
magically transmitted to you instead of the target. You are affected as
if you were hit by the attack or failed the saving throw, taking all the
damage and suffering all of the adverse effects. Any resistances or
immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise
reduce or negate the damage or effects in any way.

If you use this spell against an effect that also targets you or
includes you in its area, you suffer the effects for both yourself and
the target you spared, potentially taking damage or suffering other
consequences twice.



## Perceive Cues


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 2, inquisitor 2, ranger 2,
witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of water)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

Your senses become preternaturally keen, and you gain insight into
subtle behavioral cues. For the duration of the spell, you receive a +5
competence bonus on
[Perception] and [Sense Motive] checks.



## Phantasmal Revenge


**School** illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch and unlimited; see text

**Target** dead body touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will disbelief then Fortitude partial; see text;
**Spell Resistance** yes

When you cast this eerie spell upon a recently slain creature, you cause
a ghastly, spectral image of it to rise up from its corpse, shrieking
for vengeance before it vanishes in a burst of unnatural light. This
phantom then unerringly seeks out the creature that killed it, as long
as that creature is on the same plane, and tries to slay its killer in
turn.

Only the corpse's killer can see the phantasmal image created by this
spell. You and any others who witness the spell's casting or its
ultimate effects see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will
save to disbelieve the illusion. If that save fails, the target must
succeed on Fortitude saving throw or take 10 points of damage per caster
level from the phantasmal image. Even if the Fortitude save is
successful, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage
per caster level. You know immediately if the spell succeeded or failed
to kill its target but gain no other information, including the identity
of the target of the spell.

The creature providing the corpse must have died no more than 1 day per
caster level prior to the casting of this spell. If the creature that
provided the corpse was not, in fact, killed by another, or if the
killer is dead or no longer on the same plane, the spell fails.
*[Phantasmal revenge]* makes no moral judgments; it
targets winners of fair fights just as easily as murderers. Any given
body can only be targeted by a *[phantasmal revenge]* spell once.



## Phantasmal Web


**School** illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 5,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which may be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text;
**Spell Resistance** yes

You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that they are
engulfed in tangled webs teeming with swarms of tiny spiders. Those who
fail to disbelieve the *[phantasmal web]* are treated
as if in a *[web]* spell, but must also make
a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn or become nauseated for
that round by the phantasmal spiders.

As the *[phantasmal web]* exists only in the minds of
the targets, it cannot be burned or destroyed, and it provides no cover
(though it does provide concealment) against attacks made by the
targets. Targets cannot escape the *[phantasmal web]*
by moving, even by *teleportation*. *[Freedom of movement]*
allows unobstructed movement but does not negate the concealment or
nausea effects.

Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be engulfed
in webs and swarming spiders, but the spell has no visible effect to
other creatures (who may assist allies to disbelieve the effect).



## Pied Piping


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; **Level**
bard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V or F (musical instrument)

**Range** 90 ft.

**Area** 90-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you

**Duration** concentration + 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will partial; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You call forth a melody so compelling and attractive that creatures
belonging to a group with a specific, identifiable physical trait (such
as type, subtype, age, gender, or hair color) find it almost impossible
not to approach and follow you. You choose the nature of the creatures
you seek to attract when you cast the spell and, once you make this
choice, cannot alter it. You can only use physical traits to determine
your audience. You can never use social and other more voluntary
criteria (such as alignment, religion, nationality, or class) to select
targets for this spell.

Eligible creatures must make a saving throw each round spent within the
area of the spell and, once they fail, approach you at their normal
movement speed and stand as close to you as possible without actually
entering an occupied square. If you move, they do their best to maintain
their proximity to you and follow. Affected creatures can take no
actions other than listening to your music and following you if you
move. Those entering the area while the spell is in effect must also
successfully save or be compelled to come to you.

The attractive power of the spell does not cause affected creatures to
put themselves in jeopardy and they have enough presence of mind to
avoid or negotiate around obstacles and other perilous hazards. If
unable to approach or follow you without endangering themselves, they
simply wait, swaying to the music, until you pass out of range, at which
point they regain their senses after 1 round/caster level. If
circumstances change once you move out of range, making it possible for
affected creatures to resume their attempts to get near you they do so,
and, if they manage to return to within the area of the spell before it
wears off, the spell continues as normal. If attacked, affected
creatures can take defensive measures, even going so far as to avoid
existing threats by moving out of the area of the spell, but cannot make
attacks themselves or take any other actions until the effects of the
spell wear off. The effects of the spell persist for 1 round/caster
level even after you stop concentrating. Once the spell ceases, the
affected creatures continue to stay near you until the effects of the
spell wear off.



## Pillar of Life


**School** conjuration (healing) [light]; **Level** cleric 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** 5-ft.-square pillar of positive energy, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You conjure a pillar of positive energy in a single 5-foot square within
range that radiates light as if it were a sunrod. Living creatures
adjacent to the pillar can spend a standard action to touch the pillar
and heal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
Creatures can move into the square containing the pillar, but if an
undead creature moves into the pillar it takes 1d6 points of damage per
caster level (maximum 10d6). Undead creatures vulnerable to bright light
take 1d8 points if damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A creature
cannot benefit or suffer more than once from a single casting of this
spell.



## Planar Adaptation


**School**transmutation; **Level**alchemist 5, cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard
5, summoner 5

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 hour/level (D)

*[Planar adaptation]*grants you immunity to the
harmful environmental effects of a particular plane of existence,
including such hazards as toxicity, extreme temperatures, and lack of
air. Additionally, you gain energy resistance 20 to a single energy type
prevalent on that plane (choose one if more than one type is equally
prevalent). *[Planar adaptation]* has no effect when
cast upon your native plane.

**Planar Adaptation, Mass**

**Level**cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 6

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets**one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance**yes
(harmless)

This spell functions like *[planar adaptation]*,
except as noted above.



## Pox Pustules


**School** necromancy; **Level** druid 2, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (leaves from a toxic plant)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target
is sickened and takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot
lower Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching
furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the
Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.



## Protective Spirit


**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target**you

**Duration** 1 round/level

A *[protective spirit]* is an invisible, mindless,
shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected
attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the
*[protective spirit]* makes an immediate attack
using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a
successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of
opportunity to automatically miss. A *[protective spirit]* can defend against a number of attacks of
opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.

A *[protective spirit]* occupies your space, and
moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but
*[dispel magic]*,
*[disintegrate]*, a
*sphere of annihilation*, or a *[rod of cancellation]* affects
it. A *[protective spirit]*'s AC against touch
attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.



## Purging Finale


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a
flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, removing one of
the following conditions on a creature within range affected by your
bardic performance: cowering, dazzled, exhausted, paralyzed, shaken, or
stunned.



## Purified Calling


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** summoner 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a stick of incense)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute

Your eidolon is restored to full health when you summon it. Upon casting
this spell, you must immediately begin the ritual to summon your
eidolon. Upon completion of the ritual, your eidolon appears at full hit
points and without any damage or penalties to its ability scores,
regardless of its previous condition. In addition, any temporary
negative conditions affecting your eidolon are immediately removed.
Permanent conditions and ability drain are not affected by this spell.



## Putrefy Food and Drink


**School** transmutation; **Level** witch 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 10 ft.

**Target** 1 cu. ft./level of food and water or one potion; see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes
(object)

This spell causes otherwise edible food to rot and spoil instantly, and
water and other liquids to become brackish and undrinkable. Holy water
and similar food and drink of significance are spoiled by *[putrefy food
and drink]*, but the spell has no effect on
creatures of any type, nor upon unholy water. Water weighs about 8
pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons
and weighs about 60 pounds.

Although potions and elixirs are unaffected by the normal use of the
spell, you can instead choose to target a single such object with this
spell, destroying it if it fails a saving throw.



## Rally Point


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [good, mind-affecting]; **Level**
paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 5 ft.

**Area** one 5-ft. square

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You create a spot that has the power to briefly hearten any good
creature who comes into contact with it. A good creature who enters this
square (even if simply as part of its normal move) gains a +2 morale
bonus on attacks, saving throws, and 2 temporary hit points per caster
level for 1 round. Nongood creatures gain no benefit from this spell. A
creature cannot benefit more than once from the same casting of this
spell.



## Rampart


**School** conjuration (creation) [earth]; **Level** druid 7,
sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a handful of earth)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** 10-ft.-high earthen wall, in a line up to 10 ft. long/2
levels, or a circle with radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You create a massive rampart of hard-packed earth and stone 5 feet
thick. The *[rampart]* cannot be conjured so that it occupies
the same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section
of the *[rampart]* has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A
section of the *[rampart]* whose hit points drop to 0 is
breached. If a creature tries to break through the *[rampart]*
with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 60. A creature
can climb over the *[rampart]* with a DC 20
[Climb] check.



## Rebuke


**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** inquisitor 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 20 ft.

**Area** 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

Your wrathful words cause physical harm to your enemies. Your enemies
take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) and are
staggered for 1 round. Half of this damage is sonic damage, but the
other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not
subject to being reduced by resistance to sonic-based attacks.
*[Rebuke]* is especially devastating to foes who worship your
god, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and
stunning them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save halves the
damage and negates the staggering or stunning effect.

Enemies do not need to hear a *[rebuke]* to be harmed by it,
but it is negated by magical silence.



## Rejuvenate Eidolon


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** summoner 3

This spell functions as *[lesser rejuvenate eidolon]*, except that it cures 3d10 points


## of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** summoner 5

This spell functions as *[lesser rejuvenate eidolon]*, except that it cures 5d10 points


## of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** summoner 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of your blood)

**Range** touch

**Target** eidolon touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

By laying your hand upon an eidolon, you cause its wounds to close and
its form to solidify. This spell cures 1d10 points of damage +1 point
per caster level (maximum +5).



## Residual Tracking


**School** divination; **Level** ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a bit of plaster)

**Range** touch

**Target** footprint touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

By touching a footprint, you receive a clear mental image of the person
or creature that made it. The image has the exact same appearance as the
creature that made the footprint at the moment it made the imprint,
including any telling features or expressions, any gear or equipment, or
anything else the creature was carrying at the time. For example, the
footprint of a horse would reveal both the horse and any creature riding
it when it made the footprint.



## Resounding Blow


**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** antipaladin 4, inquisitor 5,
paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; see text; **Spell Resistance** no

You must have a melee weapon in hand to cast this spell. On a successful
melee attack, your weapon resounds with a thunderous clash. The target
takes 1d6 points of sonic damage. Your weapon is not harmed by this
attack.

If you are using your judgment ability or smite ability against the
target, it is staggered for 1 round on a successful attack. A successful
Fortitude save negates the staggering effect.

On a successful critical hit, the target is stunned for 1 round and
deafened for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the
stunning and deafening effects. If you are also using judgment or smite,
your foe makes only a single save against all effects.

This spell immediately ends if your weapon leaves your hand.
*[Resounding blow]* stacks with the
*[thundering]* weapon
property.



## Rest Eternal


**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 4, druid 5, witch 5

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M/DF (ashes and a vial of holy or unholy water)

**Range** touch

**Target** one dead creature touched

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You place a curse upon a dead creature that bars its spirit from
returning. Anyone casting a spell that would communicate with the dead
creature, return it to life, or turn it into an undead creature must
succeed on a caster level check with a DC of 11 plus your caster level.
*[Rest eternal]* cannot be dispelled, but it can be
negated with *[remove curse]* or *[break enchantment]*.



## Restful Sleep


**School** necromancy; **Level** bard 1

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of sand)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Duration** 8 hours or 24 hours; see text

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You cast this spell immediately prior to resting. While under the
effects of this spell, you and your allies enjoy a restful night's
sleep. If a subject completes a full night's rest, it regains hit points
as if it had undergone a full day of bed rest (regaining twice its
character level in hit points). If a subject completes a full day's
rest, it regains three times its character level in hit points. Any
significant interruption during the rest (such as being awoken) prevents
any healing that night and ends the effect of this spell on the awakened
subject. Any healing acquired while under the effects of *[restful sleep]* is considered natural healing, and has no affect
on effects requiring magical healing to cure.



## Resurgent Transformation


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** alchemist 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of meteoric iron worth 100 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until triggered, then 1 round/level

*[Resurgent transformation]* grants you the
ability to recover from deadly wounds with restored vitality and a will
to fight, but at a price. Once cast, *[resurgent transformation]* lies dormant for up to 1
hour per level until you are reduced to one-quarter hit points or less.
Once triggered, you immediately gain a +4 enhancement bonus to
Constitution and Strength, damage reduction 5/—, and the benefits of a
*[haste]* spell. In addition, you heal
4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).
*[Resurgent transformation]* can even save
you from death by healing the damage from an otherwise mortal wound,
though it does not prevent death from massive damage or from causes
other than hit point loss. Your mental faculties are impaired by this
magical transformation, however, causing 1d4 points of Intelligence and
Wisdom damage.

The advantages from your transformation persist for 1 round per caster
level after the spell is triggered. Once the spell ends, it takes a
heavy toll, leaving you exhausted and inflicting 1d4 points of
Constitution damage. Utilizing more than one *[resurgent transformation]* in a day is particularly
risky. The expiration of a second *[resurgent transformation]* in a 24-hour period inflicts
an additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage and results in death
from system shock unless you succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, made
after the Constitution damage has been applied.

If the spell expires or is dispelled before the *transformation* has
been triggered, no adverse effects result.



## Retribution


**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** inquisitor 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature who has just struck you with an attack

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

*[Retribution]* blasts those who have the temerity to
assault your person. You may target anyone who has just struck you with
an attack within the previous round, whether with a melee, ranged, or
natural weapon, or a spell that requires an attack roll. The target is
wracked with shooting pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls,
skills checks, and ability checks. On a successful Fortitude save, the
penalty only lasts for 1 round. A target who worships the same god as
you takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.



## Reviving Finale


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 20 ft.

**Area** a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Will half (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a
flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, and allies within
the area of the spell regain 2d6 hit points. This spell has no effect on
undead creatures.



## Righteous Vigor


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
inquisitor 3, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

Infusing the target with a surge of furious divine energy, you enhance a
creature's ability to hit an opponent based on the number of times it
has already hit that opponent with a successful attack. Each time the
subject successfully strikes an opponent with a successful melee attack,
the subject gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus on attack rolls (maximum
+4 bonus) and gains 1d8 temporary hit points (to a maximum of 20
temporary hit points). If an attack misses, the attack bonus resets to
+0 but any accumulated temporary hit points remain. The temporary hit
points disappear at the end of the spell's duration.



## River of Wind


**School** evocation [air]; **Level** druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 120 ft.

**Area** 120-ft. line

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful
winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of
wind—the direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast
the spell, and remains constant in that direction for the spell
duration. Creatures caught in a *[river of wind]* take
4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save
halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone.

A creature that begins its turn wholly or partially within a *[river of wind]* must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 20 feet
in the wind's direction of flow, take 2d6 nonlethal damage, and be
knocked prone—a successful Fortitude save means the creature merely
takes 1d6 nonlethal damage. Creatures under the effect of *[freedom of movement]* and
creatures with the air subtype are unaffected by a *[river of wind]*.



## Sacred Bond


**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 3, inquisitor 2,
paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, F (a pair of golden bracelets worth 100 gp each
worn by both you and the target)

**Range** touch; see text

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 minutes/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

To use this spell, you first touch the intended recipient, creating a
sympathetic field of healing energies between you. Once the spell has
been cast, you and the target may cast conjuration (healing) spells with
a range of touch upon each other so long as you are within close range
(25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Should either you or the target remove your
bracelet, the spell immediately ends.



## Sacrificial Oath


**School** abjuration; **Level** paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You create a powerful bond between yourself and a single creature. Until
the end of the spell's duration, each time the target is hit with an
attack or fails a saving throw, you can take the full damage of that
attack and any other effects that creature suffers. If you choose not to
take on the damage and effects, you instead take a number of points of
damage equal to your Constitution score as backlash. Any resistances or
immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise
reduce or negate the damage or effects of either the transfer or the
backlash. If you or the subject of the spell move out of line of sight,
the spell ends.



## Saddle Surge


**School** transmutation; **Level** paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Targets** you and your mount

**Duration** 1 round/level (D); see text

You and your mount form a perfect synergy that endows both of you with
advantages based upon how far you travel each round. For every 5 feet
your mount moves in a given round, you gain a +1 competence bonus on
[Ride] checks and both you and your mount
gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls made with weapons or natural
attacks for 1 round. For instance, if your mount traveled 40 feet in a
round, you would gain a +8 bonus on [Ride]
checks and you and your mount would both gain a +8 bonus on damage rolls
for 1 round, to a maximum bonus equal to your caster level. You must be
mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get
knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your
mount, the spell immediately ends.



## Sanctify Armor


**School** abjuration [good]; **Level** inquisitor 4, paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** armor touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless, object); **Spell Resistance**
yes (harmless, object)

You imbue your armor with a righteous aura. It gains a +1 enhancement
bonus per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). When using your
judgment or smite ability, you gain DR 5/evil.

An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus
for the purpose of this spell.



## Saving Finale


**School** evocation [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 1

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a
flourish, you can immediately end your bardic performance when a
creature within range affected by your bardic performance fails a saving
throw, allowing the subject to immediately reroll the failed saving
throw.



## Scent Trail


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a queen ant)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets**one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You, or a willing creature you touch, lay down a trail of scents that
only the creatures you designate at the time of casting can detect.
These creatures find it very easy to follow this trail. They gain a +20
competence bonus on any [Survival]
checks made for the purpose of tracking the creature laying this trail.
Subject creatures with the scent special ability gain a +10 competence
bonus on Wisdom or [Survival]
checks to follow the trail.

In addition, you can leave scent messages along the trail. Each word or
emotion in this message requires spending a move action in the same
spot. Subject creatures seeking to understand this message must make
another DC 20 [Survival] check,
with a -1 penalty for every word or emotion in the message, in order to
understand it. Creatures cannot benefit from this smell if they cannot
use, or do not have, a sense of smell. Creatures can use this spell to
backtrack through a dungeon, maze, or similar areas even if the creature
laying down the trail crossed over the spot multiple times.



## Screech


**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** 30-ft.-radius spread centered on you

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You emit a shrill, piercing shriek, startling those around you into
dropping their guard. Enemies in the area must make a successful saving
throw or immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from foes that
threaten them. You and your allies are unaffected by your own
*[screech]*.



## Sculpt Corpse


**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (lump of wax)

**Range** touch

**Target** one dead creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will partial; see text; **Spell Resistance** no

With a clammy caress and a word to the powers lurking beyond death, you
can reshape a dead body look like another creature or even a specific
person so long as you have first-hand knowledge of how that creature or
person actually looks. You can make the corpse one size larger or
smaller and change anything else about it including its apparent type,
gender, or age. Creatures with a reason to suspect deception may make a
Will saving throw to realize that the corpse was altered. If you chose
to make the corpse look like a specific individual anyone who knows that
individual can make a Will save to realize that the corpse is not
actually that person. However, if a creature fails its Will save by 5 or
less they believe the corpse is that of someone who closely resembled
the person they knew rather than a deliberate fake. This spell merely
changes the appearance of the corpse. Any spell or effect that targets
the corpse (such as *[speak with dead]* or *[raise dead]*) treats it as if it
still had its original appearance.



## Seamantle


**School** conjuration (creation) [water]; **Level** druid 8,
sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a cup of water)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level

You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up
to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to
your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the
*[seamantle]*, but attacks against you are treated as if you
were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover
bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have
*[freedom of movement]*
effects. The cover granted by the *[seamantle]* does not
enable you to make [Stealth] checks
or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are
unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not
function underwater (such as
*[cloudkill]*).

The *[seamantle]* blocks line of effect for any fire spell
or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells
within the *[seamantle]*; this requires a caster level check
(DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes effect as
a bubble of steam contained within the *[seamantle]* rather
than its usual effect.

The *[seamantle]* allows you to make a slam attack by
forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your
size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a
standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You
automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against
magical fire effects, your touch acts as *[dispel magic]*; this also applies
to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you
(such as *[flame blade]*,
*[flaming sphere]*, or
*[incendiary cloud]*). Even if
you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A
*[flaming]* or *[flaming burst]* weapon
that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder
fails a Fortitude save.



## Seek Thoughts


**School** divination [mind-affecting]; **Level** alchemist 3, bard 3,
inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a handful of copper coins)

**Range** 40 ft.

**Area** 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** no

Similar to *[detect thoughts]*, *[seek thoughts]* allows you to sift through the surface
thoughts of those around you. You may scan for either the answer to a
simple question (such as “Where is the hidden lair of the wererats?”) or
for information on a general topic (such as the beliefs of an evil
cult). You detect the number of creatures who are thinking about this
question or topic within range, as well as their location if they are
visible to you. *[Seek thoughts]* does not let you read
actual surface thoughts, only if a given creature is thinking about the
topic you are concentrating on. A successful Will save prevents you from
sensing a creature's thoughts for the duration of the spell.

You can maintain concentration on *[seek thoughts]*while
you engage in normal conversation, allowing you to ask leading questions
about topics of interest. A creature conversing with you while you
concentrate can notice that you are distracted with a successful DC 25
[Sense Motive] check.



## Shadow Projection


**School**necromancy [evil]; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time**1 minute

**Component**S

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 hour/level (D)

With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow,
giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead shadow
(see *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*245). Your physical body lies comatose
while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or
reflection while the spell is in effect.

While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive
abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage
attack. You do not gain the creature's *create spawn*ability, nor its
skill ranks or Hit Dice. Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal
to your own. Your *[shadow projection]* has the
undead type and may be turned or affected as undead.

If your *[shadow projection]* is slain, you return
to your physical body and are immediately reduced to -1 hit points. Your
condition becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks
to stabilize.



## Shared Wrath


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
inquisitor 4

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

This spell functions as *[wrath]*, except that you
grant multiple creatures the bonuses against your designated foe. All
subjects of *[shared wrath]* receive their bonuses
against the same creature.



## Share Language


**School** divination; **Level** bard 1, cleric 2, druid 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a page from a dictionary)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 24 hours

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You can share your facility for one particular language with another
creature. For 24 hours the target can read, understand, and communicate
to the best of its ability in any one language which you already know.
For every 5 levels you possess, you can grant the use of another
language you know, to a maximum of 5 languages at 20th level. The target
must have the physical capacity to articulate sounds, make gestures, or
engage in whatever other method speakers of the language use to
communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target
lacks the mental capacity to grasp an actual language it still gains
enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex
commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or
spoken). However, since this spell does not endow the target with
greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced vocabulary,
the person offering up instructions to non-sentient creatures must take
care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork.

Similarly, this spell does not affect the basic nature of the target, or
its disposition toward you or anyone else, so convincing it to actually
carry out these instructions could require negotiation, threats, or
outright bribery.



## Share Senses


**School** divination (scrying); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 full round

**Components** V, S, M (a hair, scale, or feather from your familiar)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** your familiar

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

Spending a moment in meditation and conjuring an image of the creature
to mind, you reshape your link with your familiar, causing it to
functions like a scrying sensor. Upon casting this spell you can hear,
see, or smell (any one, your choice) what your familiar is experiencing.
You gain the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities your familiar
has tied to the chosen sense (such as low-light vision or scent), but
use your own [Perception]
skill. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your familiar,
but you must have an active empathic link. You may change the sense you
are sharing as a standard action. Unlike other scrying spells, share
senses does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to
work through it, and you are unable to see in magical or natural
darkness unless your familiar possesses the ability to see in such
conditions.

The sensory link with your familiar can be detected as though it were a
scrying sensor.



## Shifting Sand


**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a handful of sand)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** 20-ft. spread

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; see text; **Spell Resistance** no

You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the
area. The *[shifting sand]* obliterates tracks and is
considered difficult terrain.
[Acrobatics] checks in the
area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures
entering or beginning their turn in the *[shifting sand]* must make a Reflex save each round or become
entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to
move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone.
Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as
a bonus on their saving throws.

As a move action, you may move the area of shifting sand up to 10 feet
in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spell's
area are carried along with the *[shifting sand]* in the
same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried
along or shallowly buried by the *[shifting sand]*.



## Sift


**School** divination; **Level** bard 0, inquisitor 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** one 10-ft. cube

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You examine an area at range as if you were searching for fine details
with the [Perception] skill.
Make a [Perception] check with
a -5 penalty, modified as normal for conditions. No penalty is applied
for distance. Apply the result against the DC for any hidden features,
such as secret doors, traps, or hidden treasure. You must be able to see
the area you are attempting to search, and you only find details that
can be perceived with sight or touch. *[Sift]* detects only
objects and features, not actual creatures.



## Sirocco


**School** evocation [air, fire]; **Level** druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (handful of fine sand cast into the air)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** cylinder (20-ft. radius, 60 ft. high)

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial, see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

A blast of furnace-hot wind blasts downward, inflicting 4d6 fire damage
+1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knocking them
prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the fire damage and negates
being knocked prone. Flying creatures forced into the ground by the
powerful downdraft take damage as if they fell unless they make a DC 15
[Fly] check, in which case they remain at
their original altitude. Any creature that takes damage from a sirocco
becomes fatigued (or exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a
previous round of exposure to a *[sirocco]. Creatures
with the water subtype take a -4 penalty on all saving throws against
this spell and take double normal damage.



## Sleepwalk


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
inquisitor 4, witch 4

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (a sprig of belladonna worth 100 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** unconscious creature touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a
half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided,
but remains helpless for all other purposes. The subject moves at half
speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not
capable of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than
movement except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any
Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any
damage while *sleepwalking* it must make a new saving throw or the spell
ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When
the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must
be awoken normally. While *[sleepwalk]* allows an
unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the creature, nor does
it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that moves
about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again
as a result of this movement.



## Slipstream


**School** conjuration (creation) [water]; **Level** druid 2, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a few drops of oil and water)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 minutes/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** no

You create a low-cresting wave of water that carries the target along
the surface of water or the ground. When moving across level ground, the
target's speed increases by 10 feet. If going downhill, speed increases
by 20 feet instead, but *[slipstream]* provides no movement
bonus when going uphill. While swimming, the *[slipstream]*
increases the target's swim speed by 20 feet—if the target does not have
a swim speed, this spell grants a swim speed of 20 ft.



## Snake Staff


**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 5, druid 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a knife suitable for whittling)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** 1 or more pieces of wood, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes
(object)

With a long hissing whisper, you transform ordinary pieces of wood into
various sorts of snakes that immediately attack your foes. As long as
the snakes remain within sight, you can direct their actions
telepathically as a free action. You can only apply this spell to wooden
objects not in a creature's possession or not part of a larger structure
or plant. Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of
snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes take up more
than one of your available total, as noted below. See [Snake statistics] and advanced and giant [simple templates].

*Venomous Snake*: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 1 snake.

*Constrictor Snake*: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 2 snakes.

*Advanced Venomous Snake*: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 2
snakes.

*Advanced Constrictor Snake*: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 3
snakes.

*Advanced Giant Venomous Snake*: A log or pile of debris. Counts as 4
snakes.

*Advanced Giant Constrictor Snake*: A fallen tree or a large pile of
debris. Counts as 5 snakes.



## Solid Note


**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** bard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one solidified musical note

**Duration** concentration + 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang
it, suspended, wherever you wish within range, allowing you to use it as
hook, pulley, door blocker, or anything else your imagination desires.
The exact appearance of the *[solid note]* depends on your
melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted, and with
any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size approximately
equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the *[solid note]* resists all attempts to move it but instantly
disappears if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The
note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It
cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for its
Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed
Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note
is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can
never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully
attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier) or overcome with a combat
maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your
Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the *[solid note]* simply fails to budge it and loses that action for
the round.



## Spark


**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0,
sorcerer/wizard 0, witch 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V or S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one Fine object

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes
(object)

You can make an unattended Fine flammable object catch on fire. This
works as if you were using flint and steel except that you can use
*[spark]* in any sort of weather and it takes much less time to
actually ignite an object.



## Spiked Pit


**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner
3

This spell functions as *[create pit]*,
except that the pit is lined with wickedly sharp spikes along its bottom
and walls and has a maximum depth of 50 feet. Creatures who fall into
the pit take falling damage as normal, plus 2d6 points of piercing
damage from the spikes. Any creature or object coming into contact with
the spikes along the walls, such as a creature trying to climb out, or
rope or other typical aids to climbing, takes 1d6 points of piercing
damage each round they are in contact with the walls. For those willing
to accept the damage incurred while climbing, the pit's walls have a
[Climb] DC of 20.



## Spiritual Ally


**School** evocation [force]; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** spiritual ally of force

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within
range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The *[spiritual ally]* occupies its space, though you and your allies
can move through it, since it is your ally. The *[spiritual ally]* carries a single weapon, one favored by your
deity (as for *[spiritual weapon]*), which
has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its
form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this
spell, your *[spiritual ally]* can make an attack
against a foe within its reach that you designate. The *[spiritual ally]* threatens adjacent squares and can flank and
make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The
*[spiritual ally]* uses your base attack bonus (gaining
extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom
bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the *[spiritual ally]* hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1
point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It
strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect
incorporeal creatures.

Each round after the first, you can move the *[spiritual ally]* as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet,
and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct
of force, the *[spiritual ally]* cannot be harmed by
any physical attacks, but *[dispel magic]*,
*[disintegrate]*, a
*sphere of annihilation*, or a *[rod of cancellation]* affects
it. A *[spiritual ally]*'s AC against touch attacks is
10.

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time
the *[spiritual ally]* strikes it. If the ally is
successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has
its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.



## Spite


**School** abjuration; **Level** witch 4

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (rare inks worth 250 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D) or until discharged

Choose a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower with a casting
time of 1 standard action or less. As part of the action of casting
*[spite]*, you cast the associated spell and bind it into a
defensive ward in the form of a tattoo, birthmark, or wart somewhere
upon your body. The next time you are hit by a melee attack or a combat
maneuver is used successfully against you, the stored spell is triggered
against your foe. You do not need to succeed on a touch attack to affect
the target, but in all other respects the spell is treated as though you
had cast it normally. If the attacking creature is not a valid target
for the spell, the stored spell is lost with no effect.

You can have only one *[spite]* spell in effect at a time; if
you cast this spell a second time, the previous spell effect ends.



## Stay the Hand


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** paladin
4

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level and special; see text

**Saving Throw**Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You cause a creature's arm to waver and prevent it from striking another
creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make a
melee attack against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the
target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is
wasted for the round. On a successful saving throw, the target can make
its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both
accuracy and power, taking a -5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls.
Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject
to a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it
originally targeted for the duration of the spell.



## Stone Call


**School** conjuration (creation) [earth]; **Level** druid 2, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area**cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**none; **Spell Resistance** no

A rain of dirt, gravel, and small pebbles fills the area, dealing 2d6
points of bludgeoning damage to every creature in the area. This damage
only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of
the spell, this debris covers the ground, making the entire area
difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the rocks disappear,
leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).



## Stone Fist


**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** alchemist 1, druid 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a chip of granite)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

This spell transforms your hands into living stone. While this spell is
in effect, your unarmed strikes do not provoke attacks of opportunity
and deal 1d6 points of lethal bludgeoning damage (1d4 if you are Small).
In addition, your unarmed strikes ignore the hardness of any object with
a hardness less than 8.

*[Stone to flesh]*
immediately dispels *[stone fist]*. Should you be the
target of *[transmute rock to mud]*, this
spell immediately ends and you take 4d6 points of damage.



## Stormbolts


**School** evocation [electricity]; **Level** cleric 8, druid 8,
sorcerer/wizard 8, witch 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a copper rod)

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** a 30-ft.-radius spread, centered on you

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

When you cast this spell, lightning spills forth from your body in all
directions. The bolts do not harm natural vegetation or creatures in the
area you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creatures within the
area take 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum
20d8) and are stunned for 1 round. A successful saving throw halves the
damage and negates the stun effect.



## Strong Jaw


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 4, ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

Laying a hand upon an allied creature's jaw, claws, tentacles, or other
natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creature's natural
attacks. Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the
creature were two sizes larger than it actually is. If the creature is
already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt
by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually
change the creature's size; all of its statistics except the amount of
damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.



## Stumble Gap


**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (miniature shovel costing 10 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** see text

**Duration** 1 round + 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex partial; **Spell Resistance** no

You create a shallow extradimensional hole perfectly sized to trip
anyone who steps within it. This hole occupies a single 5-foot square
with a depth of six inches. Any creature occupying the square when you
first create the hole, or who later steps into the square containing the
hole, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling prone in an
adjacent square and taking 1d6 points of damage. A creature that makes
its saving throw still stumbles ever so slightly and takes a -1 penalty
on all rolls and checks for 1 round. The spell has no effect on
creatures adjacent to the square containing the hole.



## Stunning Finale


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** up to 3 creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw**Fortitude partial; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a
flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, assaulting the
senses of the targets with your finale. Each target is stunned for 1
round. On a successful saving throw, a target is staggered for 1 round.



## Suffocation


**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a vial containing a bit of the caster's breath)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 3 rounds

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

This spell extracts the air from the target's lungs, causing swift
suffocation. The target can attempt to resist this spell's effects with
a Fortitude save—if he succeeds, he is merely staggered for 1 round as
he gasps for breath. If the target fails, he immediately begins to
suffocate. On the target's next turn, he falls unconscious and is
reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target drops to -1 hit
points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each round,
the target can delay that round's effects from occurring by making a
successful Fortitude save, but the spell effect continues for 3 rounds,
and each time a target fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step
further along the track to suffocation. This spell only affects living
creatures that must breathe. It is impossible to defeat the effects of
this spell by simply holding one's breath—if the victim fails the


## initial saving throw, the air in his lungs is extracted.


**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9

**Target** one living creature/2 levels (no two of which may be more
than 30 feet apart)

**Duration** 1 round/level

This spell functions as suffocation except as noted above. Note that the
duration of this spell is much longer, forcing those suffering from the
effect to make far more Fortitude saves to stave off eventual
suffocation.



## Summon Eidolon


**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** summoner 2

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (a silver coin)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one eidolon

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You open a rift between dimensions that summons your eidolon. Treat this
as if you had summoned your eidolon normally, except that it only
remains with you for the duration of this spell. While summoned in this
way, your eidolon cannot touch any creature warded by *[protection from evil]* or a
similar effect and your eidolon can be sent back to its home plane by
*[dispel magic]*.

If you cast this spell while your eidolon is already on your plane, this
spell has no effect. This spell allows you to summon your eidolon even
if it has been returned to its home plane due to damage.



## Swarm Skin


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 6, witch 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a crushed insect hive)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration**see text

You convert all of your soft tissue into swarms of insects or other
creatures and send them off to do your bidding, leaving nothing but your
bones and gear behind. These swarms have all their normal qualities and
abilities but also bear a tiny portion of your consciousness that allows
you to perceive what they do and to control their actions. While in this
form, you cannot use any of your own abilities or take any actions other
than controlling the swarms.

Each time you cast this spell you get a total allotment of levels equal
to your caster level and any swarm you choose to create costs one or
more of those levels. You can “spend” your allotment of levels to create
any combination of swarms so long as their total does not exceed your
caster level.

  Number of Levels   Swarm Type(s)
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2 caster levels    [Spider swarm]
  4 caster levels    [Rat swarm]
  6 caster levels    [Crab swarm], [wasp swarm]
  8 caster levels    [Centipede swarm], [leech swarm]
  10 caster levels   [Army ant swarm]

Once you create these swarms they remain in existence until destroyed or
you order them to return to your body. When all swarms have returned to
your body or are destroyed, your flesh wraps itself back around your
bones and you regain the ability to act normally. If your bones are not
where you left them you must first locate them in order to regain access
to your body. You always know if your bones are destroyed and your
consciousness remains in control of the swarms until they too are
destroyed (and your die). If you can use the swarms to get help and
arrange for someone to repair your bones (using anything that would
normally restore you to life), at which point you can return the swarms
to your body.



## Thorn Body


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 3, druid 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

This spell causes spines to grow from your exposed skin, damaging
creatures that strike you. Any creature striking you with a melee
weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of
piercing damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures using
melee weapons with reach are unaffected by this spell. Creatures that
successfully grapple you take 2d6 points of piercing damage +1 point per
caster level (maximum +15). In addition, your natural attacks and
unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage.

Thorns created by this spell persist through any new physical shape or
form you assume, such as via wildshape or any polymorph effect.



## Threefold Aspect


**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 5, witch 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S, F (silver crescent worth 5 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 24 hours (D)

*[Threefold aspect]* allows you to shift your
appearance between your natural age and three idealized age categories:
young adult (youth/maiden), adulthood (father/mother), or elderly
(elder/crone). In each case, your appearance is your own at the
appropriate age, rather than that of a new individual.

You may change between these three aspects or your actual age as a
standard action. As the young adult, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to
Dexterity and Constitution, but suffer a -2 penalty to Wisdom. In the
adult aspect, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and
Intelligence, but take a -2 penalty to Dexterity. As the elderly aspect,
you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a
-2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. As enhancement bonuses, these
stack with any bonuses or penalties you may have from your actual age
(which are untyped bonuses)—the bonuses granted by this spell represent
your idealized form in this threefold aspect rather than simply
duplicating your ability scores at any one particular age.

*[True seeing]* reveals your
natural appearance overlaid with that your aspect, recognizing both as
part of your true self. Individuals who study you closely and have
interacted with you at another apparent age recognize a resemblance (as
though family) with a successful DC 20
[Perception] check.

*[Threefold aspect]*does not alter your clothing or
equipment, and does not heal any deformity or injury unrelated to age.



## Thundering Drums


**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 15 ft.

**Area**cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You strike the ground in front of you, filling the area in front of you
with the thunder of pounding drums. Any creature in the area takes 1d8
points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 5d8) and is knocked
prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates being
knocked prone.



## Timely Inspiration


**School** divination; **Level** bard 1

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

A word of arcane-empowered inspiration can snatch victory from seeming
defeat. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill
check. The target gains a +1 competence bonus per five caster levels
(maximum +3 bonus) on the attack roll or skill check retroactively. If
the bonus is enough to make the failure a success, the roll succeeds.



## Tireless Pursuers


**School** transmutation; **Level** inquisitor 4, ranger 3

**Components** V, S, M (a hard biscuit broken into pieces)

**Range** touch

**Target** you plus one touched creature/3 levels

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

This spell functions as *[tireless pursuit]*, except as noted
above.



## Tireless Pursuit


**School** transmutation; **Level** inquisitor 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a hard biscuit)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

You harden your body against the stresses of long travel. You halve the
damage caused by hustling and forced marching (see *Pathfinder RPG Core
Rulebook* 171). In addition, for the duration of the spell you ignore
any fatigue caused by such travel. Once the spell ends, if you still
have any nonlethal damage caused by the hustling or forced march, you
become fatigued, or exhausted if already fatigued.



## Touch of Gracelessness


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

With a single touch, you reduce a creature to a fumbling clown. The
target takes a penalty to its Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster
levels (maximum 1d6+5). This penalty cannot drop the target's Dexterity
score below 1.

In addition, if the subject moves more than half its speed, it falls
prone. If the subject flies, its maneuverability is reduced by one step
(perfect maneuverability becomes good, good becomes average, and so on).

A successful Fortitude save halves the penalty to Dexterity and negates
the possibility of falling prone or the reduction to fly
maneuverabilities.



## Touch of the Sea


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 1, druid 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a fish scale)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

You cause webs to grow between the target's fingers and its feet to
transform into flippers, granting a swim speed of 30 feet along with the
standard +8 bonus on [Swim] checks and the
ability to take 10 even if distracted or endangered. You can also use
the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight line.
This transformation causes any boots or gloves the target is wearing to
meld into its form (although magic items with a continuous effect
continue to function). This spell does not grant the target any ability
to breathe water.



## Transmogrify


**School** transmutation; **Level** summoner 4

**Casting Time** 1 hour

**Components** V, S, M (a flask of quicksilver worth 1,000 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** your eidolon

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** no

Your eidolon's form shifts and transforms. This spell allows you to
change any of the eidolon's evolutions by allocating its evolution pool
on new evolutions. If you have the aspect or greater aspect ability,
this spell also allows you to change the evolution points spent to
modify you, including removing or adding points as allowed by those
abilities.

Your eidolon cannot benefit from this spell more than once per day. This
spell does not allow you to change your eidolon's base form.



## Transmute Potion to Poison


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round then 1 minute/level; see text

This extract causes you to take on a pale, sickly pallor for 1 round.
During this time, if you consume a potion, it has no effect. Instead,
your mouth fills with a vile poison that you can spit onto a weapon as a
free action. If you do not spit out the poison in 1 round, it affects
you instead. The effect of the poison depends on the level of spell
contained in the potion consumed (see below). If the poison is not used
within 1 minute per caster level it becomes inert. You can only create
one dose of poison in this way per casting of this spell.

Transmuted Poisons
------------------

The following poisons are created through the *[transmute potion to poison]* spell. The power of the poison
depends on the level of the spell contained in the transmuted potion.

**0-Level Potion Poison**

**Type** poison, injury; **Save** Fortitude DC 10

**Frequency** 1/round for 2 rounds

**Effect** 1 Dex damage; **Cure** 1 save

**1st-Level Potion Poison**

**Type** poison, injury; **Save** Fortitude DC 11

**Frequency** 1/round for 4 rounds

**Effect** 1d2 Dex damage; **Cure** 1 save

**2nd-Level Potion Poison**

**Type** poison, injury; **Save** Fortitude DC 13

**Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds

**Effect** 1d4 Str damage; **Cure** 1 save

**3rd-Level Potion Poison**

**Type** poison, injury; **Save** Fortitude DC 14

**Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds

**Effect** 1d4 Con damage; **Cure** 2 consecutive saves



## Treasure Stitching


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 4, cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of embroidered cloth no larger than
10-ft. square worth 100 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** all objects on cloth

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes
(object)

You can transform all objects placed on a cloth into an embroidered,
two-dimensional representation, making it easy for you to store and
transport the items. You can pile any amount or weight of objects on the
cloth so long as the pile stays within the dimensions of the cloth (up
to a 10-foot cube). When you cast the spell the entire pile disappears
into the cloth, replaced by a highly accurate, sewn picture of the pile
from whatever angle you wish. The cloth retains its normal weight and
dimensions. You can restore the pile of objects at any time as a
full-round action by unfurling the cloth and ordering the spell to end,
consuming the cloth. Anyone else wishing to restore the objects must
successfully dispel your spell. If the cloth is destroyed or
significantly damaged, all objects held within the cloth are lost. This
spell cannot affect artifacts or other sorts of similarly unique
objects.



## True Form


**School**abjuration; **Level**druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target**up to one creature/3 levels, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration**1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance**yes

*[True form]* removes any polymorph effect from a target
creature, returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against
creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as *[baleful polymorph]* or
*giant form*), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level,
maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success
means that the polymorph effect immediately ends.

A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a
lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its
true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt
another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the
spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If
the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the
duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from
changing its shape.



## Tsunami


**School** conjuration (creation) [water]; **Level** druid 9,
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** 10-ft.-deep wave 10 ft. wide/level and 2 ft. tall/level

**Duration** 5 rounds

**Saving Throw** see text; **Spell Resistance** no

You create a massive wave of water that then moves in a straight line
across water or land—you select the direction the wave travels (which
must be perpendicular to its width), but once set in motion, the wave
cannot change course. Over the surface of open water, the wave travels
at a speed of 60 feet per round—on land or underwater, the wave travels
at a speed of 30 feet per round.

Creatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a
Fortitude save halves this damage). In addition, the tsunami makes a
special CMB check against any creature it strikes—the wave's CMB is
equal to your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability score
modifier (whichever is highest) + 8 (for the wave's size). If this CMB
check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and
carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can
attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a
CMB or [Swim] check opposed by the wave's
CMB check—if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of
bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half) and continues being carried
along by the wave.

Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and
are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the
wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or
objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning
damage when a tsunami passes through its space—if this is enough to
destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the
wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage
dealt to objects normally is. *[Freedom of movement]*
prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not
prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.

A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by
the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving
a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.



## Twilight Knife


**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a small knife)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** floating knife of force

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create a darkly sinister floating knife that attacks the same
creature as you each round. If you choose not to attack a creature, or
you make an attack that affects multiple opponents, the knife makes no
attack during that round. The knife uses your base attack bonus modified
by either your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher) when
making this attack. Unless you specifically will it to do otherwise, or
it proves impossible to do so, the knife always maneuvers itself so that
it can flank your opponent before making the attack. The knife deals 1d4
points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range
and critical multipliers as a normal dagger. In addition, if the target
is denied a Dexterity bonus to AC or the knife flanks the target, the
knife can make sneak attacks as a rogue, inflicting an extra 1d6 points
of force damage per four caster levels on a successful attack.

A *[twilight knife]* cannot be attacked or harmed by
physical attacks, but *[dispel magic]*,
*[disintegrate]*, a
*sphere of annihilation*, or a *[rod of cancellation]* affects
it. A *[twilight knife]*'s AC against touch attacks is
12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object) plus your Dexterity modifier.

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time
the *[twilight knife]* strikes it. If the knife is
successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has
its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.



## Twin Form


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a blend of soil and the caster's blood)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level or until discharged (D)

This extract splits a perfect double of yourself from your body, dressed
and equipped exactly as you are. You are able to shift your
consciousness from one body to the other once each round as a free
action. This shift takes place either immediately before your turn or
immediately after it, but not during the round. You may act normally in
the body you inhabit. Your other self is treated as though dazed, except
it may take a single move action each round during your turn. Your twin
cannot speak while you are in your other body, and cannot flank, make
attacks of opportunity, or otherwise threaten enemies.

Both you and your twin have the same statistics and start with the
number of hit points you had when you ingested the extract. Once you
have split, these hit points are tracked separately. Any spells,
extracts, or magical effects (such as from potions) that were active
when you ingested the extract are active for both you and your twin. If
any such effects expire, are dispelled, dismissed, or otherwise used or
ended, they end for both of you. Extracts or spells cast after you split
affect you and your twin as though you were two separate targets. Your
equipment is linked between your two selves, and if an item on one is
consumed or destroyed, its duplicate is used up or destroyed as well.

The body you do not inhabit crumbles into dust when the extract's
duration expires or is dismissed. If the body you inhabit is destroyed,
you immediately shift to your surviving self and the extract immediately
ends. The body you left behind crumbles into dust, and you are stunned
until the start of your next turn. If the body you do not inhabit is
destroyed, the extract also ends immediately, but you suffer no ill
effects.

You have no special ability to sense what your second body is
experiencing, though you immediately know if it has been destroyed. You
may switch between bodies at any distance on the same plane. If your
bodies cross into separate planes (including through the use of
*[teleport]* or
*[blink]*), the body you inhabit
survives, while your other body is destroyed.



## Unfetter


**School** transmutation; **Level** summoner 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a broken chain)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** your eidolon

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** no

This spell breaks the life link between you and your eidolon. This spell
allows your eidolon to venture more than 100 feet away from you without
penalty. It can travel any distance while this spell is in effect
without penalty, but if the spell expires while the eidolon is farther
than 100 feet away, it immediately loses hit points as normal for
distance and is possibly sent back to its home plane. While this spell
is in effect, you cannot sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to your
eidolon. Damage that would be transferred due to the life bond ability
is not transferred. If you attempt to use the transposition ability
while this spell is in effect, you must roll on the
*[teleport]* mishap table, using
the “studied carefully” row.



## Universal Formula


**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (quicksilver and powdered platinum worth 100 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

As you ingest this extract, it transforms into the appropriate extract
for any formula you know of 3rd level or lower and takes effect
immediately. If the chosen formula has an expensive material component,
it must be provided along with the component for this formula. You may
not create an infused extract with this formula.



## Unwilling Shield


**School** necromancy; **Level** bard 5, inquisitor 5, sorcerer/wizard
6, witch 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 250 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

Like *[shield other]*,
*[unwilling shield]* creates a mystic connection
between you and the target, but unlike *[shield other]*, the target shares
the wounds that you receive. In addition, the link draws upon the
target's life force to supplement your own defenses. You gain a +1 luck
bonus to AC and on saving throws. You take only half damage from all
wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that
deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by
the target. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as
*charm* effects, ability damage, level draining, and death effects are
not affected. If you take a reduction in hit points from a lowered
Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target because
it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no
longer divided between you and the subject, but damage already split is
not assigned to you.

If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the
spell remains active, but damage is no longer shared until you are once
again within range of each other.



## Unwitting Ally


**School** enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw**Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You befuddle the target's mind. The target has difficulty telling friend
from foe for a short period of time. The subject is considered your ally
and not your enemies' ally while determining flanking. The subject takes
no other hostile action against your enemies due to this spell's effect.



## Vanish


**School**illusion (glamer); **Level**bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component**V, S

**Range**touch

**Target**creature touched

**Duration**1 round/level (up to 5 rounds) (D)

**Saving Throw**Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance**yes
(harmless)

This spell functions like
*[invisibility],* except
the effect only lasts for 1 round per caster level (maximum of 5
rounds). Like
*[invisibility]*, the
spell immediately ends if the subject attacks any creature.



## Veil of Positive Energy


**School** abjuration [good]; **Level** paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal or 5 ft.; see text

**Target** you or all creatures within 5 ft.; see text

**Duration** 10 minutes/level (D)

You surround yourself with a veil of positive energy, making it harder
for undead creatures to harm you. When under the effect of this spell,
you gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC and a+2 sacred bonus on saves. Both of
these bonuses apply only against attacks or effects created by undead
creatures. You can dismiss this spell before its normal duration as a
swift action on your turn to deal a number of points of positive energy
damage equal to your level to all undead creatures within 5 feet of you.



## Venomous Bolt


**School** necromancy; **Level** ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 0 ft.

**Target** one arrow or bolt

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**Fortitude negates; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You infuse a single arrow or crossbow bolt with natural venom as you
fire it. In addition to its normal damage, anyone struck by this arrow
or bolt is affected as if by the
*[poison]* spell. If the arrow is not
fired immediately, the spell ends with no effect.



## Versatile Weapon


**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (iron filings)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one weapon or 50 projectiles, all of which must be together
at the time of casting

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless, object); **Spell Resistance**
yes (harmless, object)

You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire. This spell
functions like *[greater magic weapon]*, except
that it subtly alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it
to bypass damage reduction of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold
iron, piercing, silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts
damage of its normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged.
This spell can be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.



## Vomit Swarm


**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** alchemist 2, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** personal

**Effect**one swarm of spiders

**Duration** 1 round/level

You vomit forth a [swarm of spiders] that attacks all
other creatures within its area. The swarm begins adjacent to you, but
if no living creatures are within its area, it moves in one direction of
your choosing at its normal speed. You can move the swarm or change the
swarm's direction by spending a standard action to concentrate on the
swarm, otherwise it continues moving in its current direction. If your
caster level is at least 7th, you can vomit forth a swarm of wasps
instead. Finally, if your caster level is at least 13th, you can vomit
forth a swarm of army ants.



## Vortex


**School** evocation [water]; **Level** druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a stirring spoon)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** whirlpool 50 ft. deep, 30 ft. wide at top, and 5 ft. wide at
base

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates, see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create a powerful and immobile whirlpool in any body of liquid large
enough to contain the spell's effect. Any Large or smaller creature that
comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or
take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. A Medium or smaller creature that
fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be pulled into the
whirlpool and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 1d8 points
of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct
the whirlpool to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish. A boat
that is equal in length or shorter than the vortex's width that passes
through a vortex takes 6d6 points of damage and is caught up by the
current. If the boat's captain makes a DC 25
[Profession] (sailor) check
(or if the boat is longer than the vortex's width), the boat takes only
half damage and is not caught up by the vortex.



## Wake of Light


**School** evocation [good]; **Level** paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 120 ft.

**Effect** a 10-ft.-wide path in a straight line, up to 120 ft. long

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You and your mount lay down a trail of glowing, heavenly mist behind you
as you move that makes passage easier for good creatures but more
difficult for evil creatures. This glowing trail of mist appears behind
your mount in a straight line starting where you cast the spell and
ending where your mount ends its movement. The mist takes the form of a
path 10 feet wide and up to 120 feet long and always floats just above
the ground, up to a height of 1 foot. Thereafter, the mist persists for
1 round per level.

Good creatures may walk along the top of the mist as if it were solid,
treating squares of difficult terrain containing the mist as normal
terrain. Evil creatures find the mist thick and cloying, and treat
squares of normal terrain containing the mist as difficult terrain
instead. Neutral creatures pass through the mist with no effect. The
mist has no effect on obstacles or otherwise impassable terrain, and
does not block sight or provide concealment.

Except for very special circumstances (such as a celestial or fiendish
mount), mounts use the alignment of their rider when determining how
this spell affects them. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of
this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action
that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends, although
the mist remains for the spell's normal duration.

A wake of light cannot follow across water, underwater, or through the
air in the case of a mount capable of walking on water, swimming, or
flight.



## Wall of Lava


**School** conjuration (creation) [earth, fire]; **Level** druid 8,
sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a chunk of dried lava)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** lava wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **Spell Resistance** no

This spell creates a vertical *[wall of lava]* that is 1
inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot
square per level. A *[wall of lava]'s* maximum height
cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The
wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature
or object. A section of a *[wall of lava]* can be
destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed,
the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole
created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but
remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a *[wall of lava]*, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the
creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was
via an unarmed strike or natural attack).

A creature can move through a *[wall of lava]* as a
full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check—failure indicates
that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just
attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the
wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a *[wall of lava]* inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A *[wall of lava]* also radiates heat as if it were a *[wall of fire]*, although the heat
from a *[wall of lava]* radiates from both sides.

Once per round as a move action, you can direct the *[wall of lava]* to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at
any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the
wall's overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a
ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire
damage on a hit. Holes created in a *[wall of lava]* from
this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.

All damage inflicted by physical contact with a *[wall of lava]* continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases,
but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact
(that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).



## Wall of Suppression


**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (powdered adamantine worth 1,000 gp)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** anti-magic wall occupying up to two 5 ft. cubes/level (S)

**Duration** 10 minutes/level; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

You create a wall of glittering motes that suppresses or even negates
any magical effect passing through it. The wall appears to have no
actual substance and does not physically obstruct or impede anything
attempting to move through it. However, the wall exerts a powerful
anti-magical effect. Any magic item or magical spell or effect of your
caster level or lower that passes through the wall is suppressed for 1
round per level. Spells or effects with durations expire normally, even
while thus suppressed. A spell or effect with a duration greater than
that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the
suppression ends. The wall affects all magical effects, including
spells, spell-like abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming
from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a
creature's ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any
other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a
particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with
magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes
through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal
duration.

The wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through
the wall, but it does not block line of sight. Magic items or spell
effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the
*[wall of suppression]*. The wall does not affect
artifacts, anything stemming from the direct action of a deity, or
similarly powerful sorts of magic.



## Wandering Star Motes


**School** illusion (pattern) [light, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a sprinkle of flash powder)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature and special; see text

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**Will negates; see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target
and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines
the target and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any
concealment for the target. The target must make a successful Will save.
If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make
another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target
must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will
save, the *[wandering star motes]* jump to the
nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round
or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the *[wandering star motes]* jump to the next nearest enemy within 30
feet. A given creature can only be affected by the *[wandering star motes]* once; once a target has successfully
saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no
new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its
save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy
creatures; your allies are not affected.



## Ward the Faithful


**School** abjuration; **Level** inquisitor 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** no

All creatures within the area who worship the same god as you gain a +2
deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on all saves. At 12th
level, these bonuses increase to +3. At 18th level, the bonuses increase
to +4.

If you do not worship a specific deity, the bonuses apply to those who
share your faith. If you do not have a specific faith or religion, the
spell provides benefits only to yourself. Enemies gain the benefits of
this spell if they worship the same god or share the same faith as you,
even if you view them as heretical.



## Weapon of Awe


**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** weapon touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless, object); **Spell Resistance**
yes (harmless, object)

You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The
weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores
a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1
round with no saving throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A
ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its
ammunition.

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an
unarmed strike.



## Winds of Vengeance


**School** evocation [air]; **Level** cleric 9, druid 9, sorcerer/wizard
9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level

You surround yourself with a buffeting shroud of supernatural,
tornado-force winds. These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with
perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this
fly speed. The winds shield you from any other wind effects, and form a
shell of breathable air around you, allowing you to fly and breathe
underwater or in outer space. Ranged weapons (including giant-thrown
boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons)
passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically
miss you. Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the
winds.

In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape
your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action. The
creature must make a Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of
bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (if on the ground). On a failed
save, Huge flying creatures are checked and Large-sized or smaller
flying creatures are blown away instead of knocked prone. On a
successful save, the damage is halved and the creature is not knocked
prone (or checked or blown away).



## World Wave


**School** transmutation [earth, water]; **Level** druid 9,
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** see text

**Effect** see text

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 hour/level; see text (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert,
tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with
devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates
as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects,
creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through
and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you
must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose
a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water
hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you
choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave
that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition,
the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5
feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the
crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie
down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on
solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature
per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.

When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the
direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot
change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base
land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or
a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as
it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming
into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage
(if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell). The
wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material
Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct,
outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures
with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave.
Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level
(regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world
and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence,
what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the
GM's discretion.

The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as
it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of
the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot
incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the
obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side
to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of
the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds
as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally
cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you
forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses,
at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you
are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything
primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff
face), or something man-made (such as a city).

You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot
create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.



## Wrathful Mantle


**School** evocation [force, light]; **Level** cleric 3, paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch or 5 ft.; see text

**Target** creature touched or all creatures within 5 ft.; see text

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes
(harmless)

A shimmering mantle of light shrouds the subject, casting light like a
torch. The subject of the spell gains a +1 resistance bonus on all
saving throws per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). The
subject can end the *[wrathful mantle]* at any time as
a swift action to deal 2d8 points of force damage to all creatures
within 5 feet.



## Wrath


**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
inquisitor 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a thorny vine)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute

You focus your anger against an enemy. Choose one enemy creature that
you can see. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon
damage rolls against that designated creature for every three caster
levels you have (at least +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus
on caster level checks made to overcome the creature's spell resistance,
if any. At 12th level, you gain the benefits of the [Improved Critical] feat on attack rolls made
against the designated creature. This effect doesn't stack with any
other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
