## Barbarian

The true barbarian is a creature of bestial, savage fury. Whether a
stoic tribal champion who whips herself into a berserker frenzy for the
good of her sword-sisters, or a chaotic warrior who revels in carnage
for its own sake, all barbarians share a similar approach to combat.
Once the red haze of bloodlust descends, there is only a burning rage
that carries them through the screaming fray, heedless of wounds and
leaving scattered corpses in their wake.

Presented below are a number of new rage powers to help you customize
your barbarian, as well as several classic barbarian archetypes to help
you in building your character, each one including a number of suggested
rage powers that, while not mandatory, work to flesh out the character
concept. Rage powers marked with an asterisk (\*) can be found in the
*Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*.

**Rage Powers (Ex)**: The following new rage powers can be taken by any
barbarian that meets the prerequisites. Totem rage powers grant powers
in a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem
rage powers. For example, a barbarian that selects a beast totem rage
power cannot later chose to gain any of the spirit totem rage powers.

*Beast Totem (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 natural armor
bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the barbarian
has attained. A barbarian must have the lesser beast totem rage power to
select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select
this rage power.

*Beast Totem, Greater (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian gains the
pounce special ability, allowing her to make a full attack at the end of
a charge. In addition, the damage from her claws increases to 1d8 (1d6
if Small) and the claws deal x3 damage on a critical hit. A barbarian
must have the beast totem rage power to select this rage power. A
barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.

*Beast Totem, Lesser (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian gains two claw
attacks. These attacks are considered primary attacks and are made at
the barbarian's full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of
slashing damage (1d4 if Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier.

*Boasting [Taunt] (Ex)*: While raging, the
barbarian can incite a creature to attack her by making an
[Intimidate] check to
demoralize. If the check succeeds, the target is also shaken as long as
the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack
against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on
this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage.
This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on
audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select
this power.

*Brawler*: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has
[Improved Unarmed Strike]. If
she already has the feat, her unarmed strikes deal 1d6 points of damage
(1d4 if she is Small).

*Brawler, Greater*: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has
[Two-Weapon Fighting] when making
unarmed strike attacks. A barbarian must have the brawler rage power to
select this rage power.

*Chaos Totem (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian's form becomes infused
with chaos. She gains a +4 bonus on [Escape Artist] checks and has a
25% chance to ignore extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.
A barbarian must have the lesser chaos totem rage power to select this
rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage
power.

*Chaos Totem, Greater (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian gains DR/lawful
equal to 1/2 her barbarian level. Her weapons and natural weapons are
considered chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A
barbarian must have the chaos totem rage power to select this rage
power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage
power.

*Chaos Totem, Lesser (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1
deflection bonus to AC against the attacks of lawful creatures and a +1
resistance bonus on saving throws against confusion, insanity,
polymorph, and effects with the lawful descriptor. This bonus increases
by +1 for each chaos totem rage power she possesses.

*Come and Get Me (Ex)*: While raging, as a free action the barbarian may
leave herself open to attack while preparing devastating counterattacks.
Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the barbarian
until the beginning of her next turn, but every attack against the
barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is resolved
prior to resolving each enemy attack. A barbarian must be at least 12th
level to select this rage power.

*[Disruptive]*: When raging, the barbarian
gains [Disruptive] as a bonus feat. The
barbarian must have the superstition\* rage power to select this rage
power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.

*Elemental [Rage] (Su)*: While raging, all
of the barbarian's melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of energy
damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The type is chosen when the
barbarian begins her rage. A barbarian must have the lesser elemental
rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th
level to select this rage power. Note that the barbarian can still use
her lesser elemental rage power while using this rage power, but she
must select a different energy type.

*Elemental [Rage], Greater (Su)*: While
raging, all of the barbarian's critical hits made with melee weapons
deal an additional 1d10 points of energy damage (2d10 if the weapon
deals x3 damage on a critical hit, 3d10 if the weapon deals x4 on a
critical hit). The type of this damage is the same as the type chosen
for the elemental rage power. A barbarian must have the elemental rage
power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level
to select this rage power.

*Elemental [Rage], Lesser (Su)*: As a
swift action, the barbarian can cause her melee attacks to deal an
additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or
fire) for 1 round. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this
rage power. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Energy Absorption (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy
from a single attack of her chosen energy type once per rage. She does
not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it,
instead gaining 1 temporary hit point per 3 points of damage the attack
would have inflicted. These temporary hit points last until the end of
the barbarian's rage. A barbarian must have the greater energy
resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at
least 12th level to select this rage power.

*Energy Eruption (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy
from a single attack and unleash it upon her enemies once per rage. She
does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from
it. At any point during the remainder of her rage she can unleash the
stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or 30-foot
cone. The breath weapon inflicts damage equal to the damage from the
attack absorbed by the barbarian, but creatures within the area may make
a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's
Constitution modifier) for half damage even if the original effect did
not allow a save. A barbarian must have the energy absorption rage power
to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 16th level to
select this rage power.

*Energy [Resistance] (Ex)*:
While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid,
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level
(minimum 1). The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected
and it cannot be changed. This rage power can be selected more than
once. Its effects do not stack. Each time is applies to a different
energy type.

*Energy [Resistance], Greater
(Ex)*: Once per rage, a barbarian can reduce damage by half from a
single attack against which she has energy resistance (halve the damage,
then apply resistance). A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage
power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level
to select this rage power.

*Ferocious [Mount] (Ex)*: While raging
and mounted, the barbarian's mount also gains the benefits of rage
(including greater rage and mighty rage) as long as the barbarian is
mounted or adjacent to it. While her mount is raging in this way, she
must spend one additional round of rage per round. She can elect not to
pay this cost, in which case her mount does not rage.

*Ferocious [Mount], Greater (Ex)*: While
raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the benefits of any rage
powers that are constant in effect when the barbarian is raging. It does
not gain the benefit of any rage powers that require actions to
activate, even if they are free actions. A barbarian must have the
ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must
be at least 8th level to select this rage power.

*Ferocious [Trample] (Ex)*: While raging and
mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the trample special attack
(*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary* 305). This attack inflicts 1d8 points of
damage for a Medium mount, 2d6 for a Large mount, or 2d8 for a Huge
mount, plus 1-1/2 times the mount's Strength modifier. A successful
Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the mount's Strength
modifier) halves this damage. Creatures in the mount's path or that
threaten squares it passes through may make attacks of opportunity
against either the barbarian or the mount, but not both. A barbarian
must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A
barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.

*Ferocious [Trample], Greater (Ex)*: A
barbarian's mount can affect creatures up to its own size with its
ferocious trample. In addition, it can make an overrun combat maneuver
check as a free action against a creature that fails its Reflex save (or
chooses not to save in order to take an attack of opportunity) against
its trample. A barbarian must have the ferocious trample rage power to
select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to
select this rage power.

*Fiend Totem (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian sprouts dozens of wicked
barbs from her body. Anyone striking the barbarian with a melee weapon,
an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing
damage. A barbarian must have the lesser fiend totem rage power to
select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select
this rage power.

*Fiend Totem, Greater (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian is surrounded
by an aura of menace. Good creatures adjacent to the barbarian are
shaken and take 2d6 points of slashing damage at the beginning of the
barbarian's turn as dozens of small cuts open across their flesh.
Neutral creatures that are adjacent to the barbarian are shaken, but do
not take any damage. Evil creatures are unaffected. A barbarian must
have the fiend totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian
must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.

*Fiend Totem, Lesser (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian grows a pair of
large horns, gaining a gore attack. This attack is a primary attack
(unless she is also attacking with weapons, in which case it is a
secondary attack) and is made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus
(-5 if it is a secondary attack). The gore attack deals 1d8 points of
piercing damage (1d6 if Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier
(1/2 if it is a secondary attack).

*Flesh Wound (Ex)*: Once per rage, the barbarian can try to avoid
serious harm from an attack. The barbarian must make a Fortitude save
with a DC equal to the damage that would be dealt by the attack. The
barbarian's armor check penalty applies on this saving throw. If the
save succeeds, the barbarian takes half damage from the attack and the
damage is nonlethal. The barbarian must elect to use this ability after
the attack roll is made, but before the damage is rolled. A barbarian
must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.

*Good for What Ails You (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian who takes a
drink of alcohol may attempt a new saving throw against one of the
following conditions that may be affecting her: blinded, confused,
dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked,
shaken, or sickened. If she succeeds at the save, the effect is
suppressed for the duration of the rage. She also may attempt a new
saving throw if poisoned; a successful save counts against those
required for a cure, but a failed save has no ill effect.

*Ground Breaker (Ex)*: Once per rage, the barbarian can attack the floor
around her as a standard action. This attack automatically hits and
deals damage normally. If the barbarian manages to deal more damage than
the floor's hardness, the space she occupies and all of the squares
adjacent to her become difficult terrain. Creatures in these squares,
except the barbarian, must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be knocked prone.
A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

*Guarded Life (Ex)*: While raging, if the barbarian is reduced below 0
hit points, 1 hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is
converted to nonlethal damage. If the barbarian is at negative hit
points due to lethal damage, she immediately stabilizes.

*Hurling (Ex)*: As lesser hurling, but the barbarian can increase the
range increment to 20 feet or increase the size of a hurled object by
one size category. A barbarian must have the lesser hurling rage power
to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to
select this rage power.

*Hurling, Greater (Ex)*: As hurling, but the barbarian can increase the
range increment to 30 feet or increase the size of a hurled object by
two size categories. A barbarian must have the hurling rage power to
select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to
select this rage power.

*Hurling, Lesser (Ex)*: As a full-round action while raging, the
barbarian can lift and hurl an object up to one size category smaller
than herself with both hands or two size categories smaller with one
hand as an improvised weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. This
inflicts damage as a falling object (*Core Rulebook* 443) plus the
barbarian's Strength bonus. This damage is halved if the object is not
made of stone, metal, or similar material. This is a ranged touch
attack, and the target may attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the
barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) for half damage.
The barbarian may apply [Power Attack]
to this attack as a one- or two-handed weapon, as appropriate.

*Hurling Charge (Ex)*: While raging and making a charge attack, the
barbarian may draw and throw a hurled weapon during her charge, gaining
the normal +2 attack roll bonus on the thrown weapon attack as well as
on the melee attack at the end of the charge. The barbarian must move at
least 10 feet before using a thrown weapon and at least 10 additional
feet before making a melee attack at the end of her charge. The
barbarian must have a thrown weapon in hand or have one hand free at the
beginning of her charge. A barbarian must have the lesser hurling rage
power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level
to select this rage power.

*Inspire Ferocity (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian can use a move
action to impart her reckless abandon modifier to all willing allies
within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier
(minimum 1). A barbarian must have the reckless abandon rage power to
select this rage power.

*Knockdown (Ex)*: Once per rage, the barbarian can make a trip attack
against one target in place of a melee attack. If successful, the target
takes damage equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier and is knocked
prone. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

*Liquid Courage (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian increases her morale
bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects by +1 for each
alcoholic drink she consumes during her rage, to a maximum of +1
increase per four barbarian levels.

*Overbearing Advance (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian inflicts damage
equal to her Strength bonus whenever she succeeds at an overrun combat
maneuver.

*Overbearing Onslaught (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian may overrun
more than one target per round, with a -2 penalty on her CMB for each
overrun check after the first. A barbarian must have the overbearing
advance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at
least 6th level to select this rage power.

*Reckless Abandon (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian can take a -1
penalty to AC to gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls. The AC penalty
increases by -1 and the attack roll bonus increases by +1 at 4th level
and every four levels thereafter.

*Roaring Drunk (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 morale
bonus on [Intimidate] checks
and to the save DC of any fear effects she creates for each alcoholic
drink she has consumed during her rage, to a maximum of +1 per four
barbarian levels.

*Smasher (Ex)*: Once per rage, whenever the barbarian makes an attack
against an unattended object or a sunder combat maneuver, she can ignore
the object's hardness. This ability must be used before the attack roll
or sunder check is made.

*[Spellbreaker]*: When raging, the
barbarian gains [Spellbreaker] as a
bonus feat. A barbarian must have the disruptive rage power and be at
least 12th level to select this rage power.

*Spirit Steed (Su)*: While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount
gains DR/magic equal to 1/2 the barbarian's level. The mount's natural
weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage
power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

*Spirit Totem (Su)*: While raging, the spirits that surround the
barbarian make it difficult for her enemies to see her. The spirits
grant the barbarian a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks and melee
attacks made by creatures that are not adjacent to the barbarian
(typically due to reach). A barbarian must have the lesser spirit totem
rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th
level to select this rage power.

*Spirit Totem, Greater (Su)*: While raging, the spirits that surround
the barbarian become dangerous to any enemy adjacent to the barbarian.
Living enemies adjacent to the barbarian at the start of her turn take
1d8 points of negative energy damage. In addition, the spirit wisps can
now attack foes that are up to 15 feet away from the barbarian and the
slam attack deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage. A barbarian must
have the spirit totem rage power and be at least 10th level to select
this rage power.

*Spirit Totem, Lesser (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian is surrounded
by spirit wisps that harass her foes. These spirits make one slam attack
each round against a living foe that is adjacent to the barbarian. This
slam attack is made using the barbarian's full base attack bonus, plus
the barbarian's Charisma modifier. The slam deals 1d4 points of negative
energy damage, plus the barbarian's Charisma modifier.

*Staggering Drunk (Ex)*: While raging, a barbarian gains a +1 dodge
bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity for each alcoholic drink she
has consumed during her rage, to a maximum of +1 per four barbarian
levels.

*Witch Hunter (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 bonus on
damage rolls against creatures possessing spells or spell-like
abilities. This damage bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the
barbarian has obtained. A barbarian must have the superstition\* rage
power to select this rage power.

### Breaker

While most barbarians are skilled at breaking things, some find the need
to destroy their surroundings an almost uncontrollable urge when in the
middle of a rage. These barbarians are a danger not only to their foes,
but also to the very environment around them. A breaker barbarian has
the following class features.

**Destructive (Ex)**: Whenever the breaker barbarian makes a melee
attack that targets an unattended object or makes a sunder combat
maneuver, she adds half her barbarian level (minimum +1) on the damage
roll. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Battle Scavenger (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the breaker barbarian suffers
no penalty on attack rolls when using an improvised weapon or a weapon
with the broken condition. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on damage
rolls with improvised or broken weapons for every three levels beyond
3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the breaker
archetype: ground breaker, smasher, and strength surge\*.

### Brutal Pugilist

Some barbarians focus on using their bare hands to tear their opponents
limb from limb. These brutal pugilists also learn a great deal about
various combat maneuvers, using them to cripple or crush their foes. A
brutal pugilist has the following class features.

**Savage Grapple (Ex)**: At 2nd level, the brutal pugilist takes only
half the normal penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat
maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition. She can make an
attack of opportunity against creatures trying to grapple her even if
they possess the [Improved Grapple]
feat or the grab special attack. If she hits with this attack of
opportunity, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her CMD against the
grapple attempt. She cannot make these attacks of opportunity once a
grapple has succeeded. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Pit Fighter (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the brutal pugilist has learned
combat tricks from fighting in pit brawls and gladiatorial arenas. She
selects one combat maneuver and gains a +1 insight bonus on her CMB or
to her CMD in that maneuver. This bonus increases to +2 if the barbarian
is wearing no armor (shields are allowed). At every three levels after
3rd, the barbarian may select another combat maneuver and add this bonus
on her CMB or to her CMD. This bonus can be applied to each maneuver no
more than twice, once on CMB and once to CMD. This ability replaces trap
sense.

**Improved Savage Grapple (Ex)**: At 5th level, the brutal pugilist
takes no penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver
checks when she has the grappled condition. She also is treated as one
size larger than her actual size when determining whether she can be
grappled using the grab ability or swallowed by another creature. This
ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the brutal
pugilist archetype: animal fury\*, brawler, greater brawler,
knockback\*, knockdown, overbearing advance, overbearing onslaught, and
strength surge\*.

### Drunken Brute

Barbarians are known for their ability to consume potent drink, but
drunken brutes turn drinking into a combat tactic, using the potent
liquor to fuel their rage and grant them additional powers. A drunken
brute has the following class feature.

**Raging Drunk (Ex)**: While raging, the drunken brute can drink a
potion, or a tankard of ale or similar quantity of alcohol, as a move
action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A potion has its
normal effect, while an alcoholic drink allows the barbarian to maintain
her rage that round without expending a round of rage for the day
(instead of the alcohol's normal effects). For each alcoholic drink
consumed while raging, the barbarian is nauseated for 1 round when her
rage expires, in addition to the normal fatigue that follows a rage.
Tireless rage does not negate this nauseated condition but the internal
fortitude rage power does. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the drunken brute
archetype: boasting taunt, good for what ails you, internal fortitude\*,
liquid courage, moment of clarity\*, roaring drunk, and staggering
drunk.

### Elemental Kin

Some barbarian tribes have strong ties to the elemental forces of
nature. Their shamans anoint the warriors at birth, tying them to the
patron element of the tribe and granting them lasting boons against such
forces. An elemental kin has the following class feature.

**Elemental Fury (Ex)**: At 3rd level, whenever the elemental kin takes
an amount of energy damage equal to or greater than her barbarian level
while raging, she adds 1 to the total number of rounds that she can rage
that day. At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the number of
extra rounds per energy attack increases by +1, to a maximum of +6
rounds per energy attack at at 18th level. This ability replaces trap
sense.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the elemental kin
archetype: elemental rage, energy absorption, energy eruption, energy
resistance, greater elemental rage, greater energy resistance, and
lesser elemental rage.

### Hurler

A raging barbarian is frightening enough in melee, but some become
skilled at throwing objects at their foes before closing in for the
kill. A hurler has the following class feature.

**Skilled Thrower (Ex)**: The hurler is skilled at throwing objects in
combat. Increase the range increment of any thrown weapon or object by
10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the hurler
archetype: hurling, greater hurling, hurling charge, lesser hurling,
strength surge\*, and surprise accuracy\*.

### Invulnerable Rager

Some barbarians learn to take whatever comes their way, shrugging off
mortal wounds with ease. These barbarians invite their enemies to attack
them, and use pain to fuel their rage. An invulnerable rager has the
following class features.

**Invulnerability (Ex)**: At 2nd level, the invulnerable rager gains
DR/— equal to half her barbarian level. This damage reduction is doubled
against nonlethal damage. This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved
uncanny dodge, and damage reduction.

**Extreme Endurance (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the invulnerable rager is
inured to either hot or cold climate effects (choose one) as if using
*[Endure Elements]*.
In addition, the barbarian gains 1 point of fire or cold resistance for
every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the invulnerable
rager archetype: come and get me, guarded life, increased damage
reduction\*, inspire ferocity, reckless abandon, and renewed vigor\*.

### Mounted Fury

Many barbarian tribes are masters of the horse, teaching their members
how to ride from a young age. As a result, barbarians from such tribes
are even more terrifying when mounted, using their steeds' speed and
strength to great advantage. A mounted fury has the following class
features.

**Fast Rider (Ex)**: The speed of any mount the barbarian rides is
increased by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Bestial Mount (Ex)**: At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service
of a feral mount. This ability functions as a druid's animal companion,
using the barbarian's level -4 as her effective druid level. This
companion must be one that she is capable of riding and is suitable as a
mount. A Medium barbarian can select a camel or a horse. A Small
barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a
dog if she is at least 8th level. Whenever a barbarian is raging while
mounted on her bestial mount, the mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its
Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny
dodge.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the mounted fury
archetype: ferocious mount, ferocious trample, greater ferocious mount,
greater ferocious trample, and spirit steed.

### Savage Barbarian

Some barbarians are truly savage, having little training in modern arms.
These savage barbarians learn to avoid blows and toughen up their skin.
A savage barbarian has the following class features.

**Naked Courage (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the savage barbarian gains a +1
dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear
when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1
for every six levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Natural [Toughness] (Ex)**: At 7th level,
the savage barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC when wearing
no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every
three levels beyond 7th. This ability replaces damage reduction.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the savage
barbarian archetype: flesh wound, guarded stance\*, increased damage
reduction\*, intimidating glare\*, rolling dodge\*, superstition\*, and
terrifying howl\*.

### Superstitious

Many barbarians distrust magic. While most just shy away from magic,
others focus their rage on users of such foul arts. These barbarians are
naturally distrusting, and develop keen senses to protect them from
harm. A superstitious barbarian has the following class features.

**Sixth Sense (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the superstitious barbarian gains a
+1 bonus on initiative and a +1 insight bonus to AC during surprise
rounds. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 3rd.
This ability replaces trap sense.

**Keen Senses (Ex)**: At 7th level, the superstitious barbarian gains
low-light vision (triple normal vision range in dim light if she already
has low-light vision). At 10th level, she gains darkvision 60 feet (or
adds 60 feet to the range of any darkvision already possessed). At 13th
level, she gains scent. At 16th level, she gains blindsense 30 feet. At
19th level, she gains blindsight 30 feet. This ability replaces damage
reduction.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the superstitious
archetype: clear mind\*, disruptive, roused anger\*, spellbreaker,
superstition\*, and witch hunter.

### Totem Warrior

A barbarian often has a special totem that is the patron of her tribe.
While individual totems vary, those in the tribe that call upon a totem
receive similar abilities. Totem warrior barbarians can select from the
following rage powers.

**Rage Powers**: The totem warrior is based entirely upon his totem rage
powers. In addition to the totem powers themselves, the following rage
powers complement the totem warrior archtype (depending on the totem
chosen): animal fury\*, low-light vision\*, night vision\*, raging
climber\*, raging leaper\*, raging swimmer\*, and swift foot\*.


## Bard

A good bard can sing the birds from the trees or talk a king into
abdicating his throne. A jack of all trades, the bard sees little need
to restrict himself to a single talent, picking up a little of this and
a little of that, but always with a keen eye for other people and how
they might be manipulated, whether through artistic performances or more
mundane avenues. Presented below are several classic bardic themes.

### Arcane Duelist

A master of the martial applications of steel and spell, the arcane
duelist blends both into a lethal combination.

**[Arcane Strike]**: Arcane duelists
gain [Arcane Strike] as a bonus feat at
1st level. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

**Bardic Performance**: An arcane duelist gains the following types of
bardic performance.

*Rallying Cry (Su)*: At 1st level, an arcane duelist can use performance
to rally dispirited allies. Each round he makes an
[Intimidate] check. Any ally
(including the bard) within 30 feet may use this check in place of his
own saving throw against fear and despair effects. Those already under a
fear or despair effect can attempt a new save each round using the
bard's [Intimidate] check.
Rallying cry does not work on effects that don't allow saves. This is a
mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance
replaces countersong.

*Bladethirst (Su)*: An arcane duelist of 6th level or higher may use
performance to grant one weapon, one natural weapon, one end of a double
weapon, or 50 items of ammunition of the same type within 30 feet a +1
enhancement bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by +1 for every
three levels after 6th (maximum +5 at 18th level). These bonuses stack
with existing bonuses and may be used to increase the item's enhancement
bonus up to +5 or to add any of the following weapon properties:
*[defending]*,
*[distance]*, *[ghost touch]*,
*[keen]*, *[mighty cleaving]*,
*[returning]*,
*[shock]*, *[shocking burst]*,
*[seeking]*,
*[speed]*, or
*[wounding]*. If the weapon is
not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before adding
special abilities. This performance replaces suggestion.

*Mass Bladethirst (Su)*: An arcane duelist of 18th level or higher can
use his bladethirst performance to enhance the weapons of as many allies
as desired within 30 feet. The bonus provided by this power is +4 if
conferred on two allies, +3 for three allies, +2 for four allies, and +1
for five or more allies. The power granted to each weapon must be
identical. This ability replaces mass suggestion.

**Bonus Feats**: An arcane duelist weaves might and magic in his combat
style, gaining the following bonus feats at 2nd level and every four
levels thereafter: 2nd level—[Combat Casting], 6th
level—[Disruptive], 10th
level—[Spellbreaker], 14th
level—[Penetrating Strike], 18th
level—[Greater Penetrating Strike]. This ability
replaces versatile performance and well-versed.

**Arcane Bond (Ex)**: At 5th level, an arcane duelist gains the arcane
bond ability as a wizard, using a weapon as his bonded item, allowing
him to cast any one addition spell that he knows once per day. He may
not choose a familiar or other type of bonded item. He may use the hand
holding his bonded weapon for somatic components. This ability replaces
lore master.

**Arcane Armor (Ex)**: At 10th level, an arcane duelist gains Medium
Armor Proficiency and can cast bard spells in medium armor with no
chance of arcane spell failure. At 16th level, he gains Heavy Armor
Proficiency and can cast bard spells in heavy armor with no arcane spell
failure. This ability replaces jack of all trades.

### Archivist

Some bards greatly prefer academic pursuits to the drama (and sometimes
melodrama) of their artistic brethren.

**Bardic Performance**: An archivist gains the following types of bardic
performance.

*Naturalist (Ex)*: An archivist who has identified a creature with a
[Knowledge] check appropriate to
its type can use performance to share strategies for defeating it with
allies in combat. The archivist and any allies within 30 feet gain a +1
insight bonus to AC and on attack rolls and saving throws against
exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like abilities used by creatures of
that specific kind of monster (e.g., frost giants, not all giants or all
humanoids). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every six levels
thereafter. This language-dependent ability requires visual and audible
components. This ability replaces inspire courage.

*Lamentable Belaborment (Ex)*: At 6th level, an archivist can bewilder a
creature already fascinated by his performance. Using this ability does
not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action
to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate
effect). The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level
+ the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this
power for 24 hours, but failure leaves the target either dazed or
confused (archivist's choice) for as long as the performance continues.
If the target takes damage, this effect ends immediately. This
mind-affecting ability relies on audible components. This ability
replaces suggestion.

*Pedantic Lecture (Su)*: At 18th level, an archivist can affect as many
creatures with lamentable belaborment as he currently has fascinated. In
addition, he may choose to cause targets to fall asleep rather than be
dazed or confused. This ability replaces mass suggestion.

**Lore Master (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an archivist may take 20 on
[Knowledge] checks once per day,
plus once per six levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces versatile
performance.

**Magic Lore (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an archivist gains a bonus on
[Spellcraft] checks to
identify magic items or decipher scrolls equal to half his bard level
and may take 10 on such checks. An archivist can use [Disable Device] to disarm
magical traps as per a rogue's trapfinding ability and gains a +4 bonus
on saves against magical traps, language-dependent effects, and symbols,
glyphs, and magical writings of any kind. This ability replaces
well-versed.

**Jack of All Trades (Ex)**: At 5th level, an archivist can use any
skill, even if the skill normally requires him to be trained. At 11th
level, he considers all skills to be class skills, and at 17th level he
can take 10 on any skill check, even if it is not normally allowed. This
ability replaces lore master.

**Probable Path (Ex)**: At 10th level, an archivist can calculate the
action likely to bring success with the least risk. Once per day, he can
take 10 on any d20 roll. He may use this ability one additional time per
day for every three levels after 10th. This ability replaces jack of all
trades.

### Court Bard

Spending years studying all of the finer points of erudition and
etiquette, the court bard takes up the role of resplendent proclaimer
and artist-in-residence at the hand of nobility, royalty, and the
well-moneyed elite who aspire to join their ranks.

**Bardic Performance**: A court bard gains the following types of bardic
performance.

*Satire (Su)*: A court bard can use performance to undermine the
confidence of enemies who hear it, causing them to take a -1 penalty on
attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a -1 penalty on saves against
fear and charm effects as long as the bard continues performing. This
penalty increases by -1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter.
Satire is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible
components. This performance replaces inspire courage.

*Mockery (Su)*: A court bard of 3rd level or higher can subtly ridicule
and defame a specific individual. The bard selects one target who can
hear his performance. That individual takes a -2 penalty on Charisma
checks and Charisma-related skill checks as long as the bard continues
performing. This penalty increases by -1 every four levels after 3rd.
Mockery is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that relies on
audible components. This performance replaces inspire competence.

*Glorious Epic (Su)*: A court bard of 8th level or higher can weave
captivating tales that engross those who hear them. Enemies within 30
feet become flat-footed unless they succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2
the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). A save renders them immune
to this ability for 24 hours. Glorious epic is a language-dependent,
mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance
replaces dirge of doom.

*Scandal (Su)*: A court bard of 14th level or higher can combine
salacious gossip and biting calumny to incite a riot. Each enemy within
30 feet is affected as if by a *[song of discord]* for as long
as it can hear the performance. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the
bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect, and that
creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Scandal is a
language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components.
This performance replaces frightening tune.

**Heraldic Expertise (Ex)**: A court bard gains a bonus equal to half
his bard level on [Diplomacy],
[Knowledge] (history),
[Knowledge] (local), and
[Knowledge] (nobility) checks
(minimum +1). Once per day, the court bard can also reroll a check
against one of these skills, though he must take the result of the
second roll even if it is worse. He can reroll one additional time per
day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. This ability replaces
bardic knowledge.

**Wide Audience (Su)**: At 5th level, a court bard can choose to affect
a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot radius with bardic performances that
affect an area. In addition, for every five levels beyond 5th, the area
of such powers is increased by 10 feet (radius) or 20 feet (cone). If
the power instead affects multiple creatures, it affects one additional
creature than normal for every five levels beyond 5th. This does not
affect powers that affect only a single creature. This ability replaces
lore master and jack of all trades.

### Detective

Piecing together clues and catching the guilty with sheer cleverness,
the detective is skilled at divining the truth.

**Bardic Performance**: A detective gains the following types of bardic
performance.

*Careful Teamwork (Su)*: A detective uses performance to keep allies
coordinated, alert, and ready for action. All allies within 30 feet gain
a +1 bonus on Initiative checks,
[Perception], and [Disable Device] checks for 1
hour. They also gain a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saves and to AC
against traps and when they are flat-footed. These bonuses increase by
+1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. Using this ability
requires 3 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be
able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. This ability
is language-dependent and requires visual and audible components. This
performance replaces inspire courage.

*True Confession (Su)*: At 9th level, a detective can use performance to
trick a creature into revealing its secrets. Using this ability requires
a successful [Sense Motive]
check to see through a [Bluff] or notice
mental compulsion. After 3 continuous rounds of performance, the target
must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha
modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours.
On a failed save, a liar inadvertently reveals the lie and the truth
behind it. A creature under a charm or compulsion reveals the nature of
its enchantment and who placed it (if the creature knows) and gains a
new saving throw to break free from the enchantment. This ability is
language-dependent and requires audible components. Using this power
requires only 2 rounds of performance at 15th level, and 1 round of
performance at 20th level. This performance replaces inspire greatness.

*Show Yourselves (Ex)*: At 15th level, a detective can use performance
to compel creatures to reveal themselves when hiding. All enemies within
30 feet must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's
Cha modifier). If they fail, they must cease using
[Stealth], unlock and open doors
between themselves and the detective, and dismiss, suppress, or dispel
if necessary magical effects that grant invisibility or any other form
of concealment from the detective. As long as they can hear the
performance, affected creatures may not attack or flee until they have
eliminated every such effect, though they are freed from this compulsion
immediately if attacked. Creatures in the area must make this save each
round the bard continues his performance. This ability is
language-dependent and requires audible components. This performance
replaces inspire heroics.

**Eye for Detail (Ex)**: A detective gains a bonus equal to half his
level on [Knowledge] (local),
[Perception], and [Sense Motive] checks, as well as
[Diplomacy] checks to gather
information (minimum +1). This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

**Arcane Insight (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a detective can find and disable
magical traps, like a rogue's trapfinding ability. In addition, he gains
a +4 bonus on saving throws made against illusions and a +4 bonus on
caster level checks and saving throws to see through disguises and
protections against divination (such as *[magic aura]*,
*[misdirection]*, and
*[nondetection]*). This
ability replaces well-versed.

**Arcane Investigation**: In addition, a detective's class spell list
includes the following: 1st—*[Detect Chaos]/evil/law/good*;
2nd—*[Zone of Truth]*; 3rd—*[Arcane Eye], [Speak with Dead],
[Speak with Plants]*; 4th—*[Discern Lies]*; 5th—*[Prying Eyes],
[Stone Tell]*; 6th—*[Discern Location], [Find the Path],
[Greater Prying Eyes], [Moment of Prescience]*. A detective may add
one of these spells or any divination spell on the bard spell list to
his list of spells known at 2nd level and every four levels thereafter.
This ability replaces versatile performance.

### Magician

A magician dabbles in performance, but sees it as a means to tap into
universal energies and channel them.

**Bardic Performance**: A magician gains the following types of bardic
performance.

*Dweomercraft (Su)*: A magician can use performance to manipulate
magical energies. Allies of the magician gain a +1 bonus on caster level
checks, concentration checks, and attack rolls with spells and
spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every
six levels thereafter. This ability relies on visual and audible
components. It replaces inspire courage.

*Spell Suppression (Su)*: A 8th level, a magician can use performance to
counter the spells of his foes. Once the bard begins using this
performance, he tracks the number of rounds it has been in use. While
performing, as an immediate action, he can attempt to counter any spell
that he can identify using
[Spellcraft], so long as that
spell's level is equal or less than the total number of rounds he has
been performing spell suppression. The attempt to counter the spell is
made as if using *[Dispel Magic]*, using the bard's
level as the caster level. If successful, the bardic performance
immediately ends. This ability requires audible components. This
performance replaces dirge of doom.

*Metamagic Mastery (Ex)*: At 14th level, a magician can use performance
to apply a metamagic feat to a spell he is about to cast without
increasing the casting time. The bard must still expend a higher-level
slot to cast this spell. This causes the performance to immediately end.
This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces
frightening tune.

**Magical Talent (Ex)**: A magician gains a bonus equal to half his
level on [Knowledge] (arcana),
[Spellcraft], and [Use Magic Device] checks. This
ability replaces bardic knowledge.

**[Improved Counterspell]**: A
magician gains [Improved Counterspell] as a bonus feat.
This ability replaces countersong.

**Extended Performance (Su)**: At 2nd level, a magician can extend the
duration of bardic performance after he stops concentrating by
sacrificing a spell slot as a swift action. The performance effect
lingers for 1 extra round per level of the spell. Only one spell may be
sacrificed per performance, and performance types that take affect after
a specific number of rounds cannot be extended. This ability replaces
well-versed.

**Expanded Repertoire (Ex)**: At 2nd level and every four levels
thereafter, a magician can add one spell to his spells known from the
spell list of any arcane spellcasting class. The spell must be of a
level he can cast. This ability replaces versatile performance.

**Arcane Bond (Ex)**: At 5th level, a magician gains the arcane bond
ability as a wizard. He may not choose a familiar or a weapon as a
bonded item. This ability replaces lore master.

**Wand Mastery (Ex)**: At 10th level, when a magician uses a wand
containing a spell on his spell list, he uses his Charisma bonus to set
the wand's save DC. At 16th level, when using such a wand, he uses his
caster level in place of the wand's caster level. This ability replaces
jack of all trades.

### Sandman

Combining performance with stealth, trickery, and guile, the sandman
uses cleverness to keep others off-balance.

**Bardic Performance**: A sandman gains the following types of bardic
performance.

*Stealspell (Su)*: A sandman can use performance to steal spells from
his foes and add them to his list of spells known. Once the performance
is started, the bard can steal a prepared spell or a spell known from
another creature with a touch attack as a standard action. The target
receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha
bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman may choose a spell to steal,
but if the target does not possess the spell, the bardic performance
immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random, but it is always
of the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible. The target
loses the prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it to his
list of spells known for as long as the performance continues, after
which it reverts to the original recipient. While stolen, the bard can
cast the spell using his available spell slots. This use does not
consume the stolen spell. If the bard steals another spell while a spell
is stolen, the previous spell immediately reverts to its original owner.
This ability requires visual components. This performance replaces
inspire courage.

*Slumber Song (Sp)*: At 6th level, a sandman can use his performance to
cause a creature he has already fascinated to fall asleep (as *[Deep Slumber]*, but with no HD
limit). Otherwise, this ability functions like suggestion. This
performance replaces suggestion.

*Dramatic Subtext (Su)*: At 9th level, a sandman can use bardic
performance to cast spells without obvious visual or audible components
while retaining the spell's normal effects. Observers must succeed at a
[Perception] check opposed by
a sandman's [Sleight of Hand] check to notice
that the sandman is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting
still provokes attacks of opportunity). The bard must use this
performance for at least 2 rounds before casting a spell; otherwise he
is automatically detected and the performance ends. This ability
replaces inspire greatness.

*Greater Stealspell (Su)*: A sandman's stealspell power improves at 15th
level. When a target fails a save against his stealspell performance,
the sandman discovers its spell resistance (if any) and all spells it
has prepared or knows. He can then choose which spell to steal. The
sandman may forgo stealing a spell and instead reduce the target's SR by
an amount equal to half his bard level and gain that amount of spell
resistance for as long as he continues performing. If he steals
additional spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR. If he
steals a spell or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately
reverts back to its owner. This performance replaces inspire heroics.

*Mass Slumber Song (Sp)*: At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song
to affect any number of fascinated creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise,
this ability functions like *[Mass Suggestion]*. This
performance replaces *[Mass Suggestion]*.

*Spell Catching (Su)*: At 20th level, a sandman who saves against a
spell or spell-like ability that targets only him (not including area
spells) may use bardic performance as an immediate action. He must
attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell's original caster
level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect without
harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster's
level and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using
this ability consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to
the spell's level, even if the check fails. This performance replaces
deadly performance.

**Master of Deception (Ex)**: A sandman gains a bonus equal to half his
level on [Bluff], [Sleight of Hand], and
[Stealth] checks. He may also disarm
magical traps with [Disable Device] as a rogue's
trapfinding ability. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

**Sneakspell (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a sandman adds +1 to the save DC of
spells and bardic performance against opponents who are denied their Dex
bonus. This increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 18th level. In
addition, at 6th level he gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to
overcome spell resistance against such foes, and this bonus increases to
+4 at 14th level. This ability replaces versatile performance.

**Trap Sense (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a sandman gains a +1 bonus on Reflex
saves against traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against traps. These
bonuses increase by +1 every three levels after 3rd. This ability
replaces inspire competence.

**Sneak Attack (Ex)**: At 5th level, a sandman inflicts +1d6 points of
damage against targets within 30 feet that he flanks or that are denied
their Dex bonus to AC against him. This damage increases by +1d6 every
five levels after 5th. This ability replaces lore master.

### Savage Skald

Far from civilization, furious tribes have their own war-singers,
work-chanters, and lore-keepers, savaging enemies with song and sword
alike.

**Bardic Performance**: A savage skald gains the following types of
bardic performance.

*Inspiring Blow (Su)*: A savage skald roars his war-cries with each
telling blow. When he confirms a critical hit, he can start this
performance as an immediate action (ending any other performances). He
gains temporary hit points equal to his Charisma modifier (if positive),
and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on their next
attack roll prior to the start of his next turn. These temporary hit
points remain until the bard ends his performance. This performance
replaces fascinate.

*Incite [Rage] (Su)*: At 6th level, a
savage skald can induce a furious rage in one creature within 30 feet.
This effect functions as a *[Rage]* spell
that lasts as long as the target can hear the bard's performance;
however, unwilling creatures can be affected if they fail a Will save
(DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success
renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. The bard cannot
target himself with this ability. If the target has the rage class
feature, it can instead immediately rage and stay in this rage without
consuming rounds of rage per day as long as the bard continues
performing. This mind-affecting effect requires audible components. This
performance replaces suggestion.

*Song of the Fallen (Sp)*: At 10th level, a savage skald can duplicate
the effect of a *horn of Valhalla*. This effect requires 10 continuous
rounds of performance and summons barbarians as a silver horn at 10th
level, as a brass horn at 13th level, as a bronze horn at 16th level,
and as an iron horn at 19th level. The warriors remain only as long as
the bard continues his performance. This ability requires audible
components. This performance replaces jack of all trades.

*Berserkergang (Ex)*: At 12th level, a savage skald can inspire a
rapturous battle trance that suppresses pain, stunning, and fear effects
for one creature, plus one additional creature per three levels after
12th. Affected creatures also gain DR 5/— (DR 10/— against nonlethal
damage); this benefit stacks with the damage reduction class ability of
barbarians. This mind-affecting ability requires audible components.
This performance replaces soothing performance.

*Battle Song (Su)*: At 18th level, a savage skald can affect all allies
within 30 feet when using performance to incite rage. This performance
replaces mass suggestion.

### Sea Singer

The sea singer calls the blue waters his home, and is much in demand
among sea captains wishing good fortune for their crew and hull as they
ply the tradewinds far and wide.

**Bardic Performance**: A sea singer gains the following types of bardic
performance.

*Sea Shanty (Su)*: A sea singer learns to counter seasickness and
exhaustion during long sea voyages. Each round of a sea shanty, he makes
a [Perform] skill check. Allies
within 30 feet (including the sea singer) may use his
[Perform] check in place of a saving
throw against becoming exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, or sickened; if
already under such an effect, a new save is allowed each round of the
sea shanty, using the bard's
[Perform] check for the save. A sea
shanty has no effect on instantaneous effects or effects that do not
allow saves. This ability requires audible components. This performance
replaces countersong.

*Still Water (Su)*: At 3rd level, a sea singer can use performance to
calm rough waters within 30 feet, reducing the DC for
[Profession] (sailor) and
[Swim] checks, as well as for
[Acrobatics] and
[Climb] checks aboard ship, by an amount
equal to the bard's level (to a minimum of DC 10) for as long he
continues to perform. He can extend this duration to 1 hour by playing
for 10 consecutive rounds. This ability requires audible components.
This performance replaces inspire competence.

*Whistle the Wind (Su)*: A sea singer of 6th level or higher can use
performance to create a *[Gust of Wind]*. This wind lasts for
as long as he continues his performance. He can extend this duration to
1 minute by playing for 5 consecutive rounds. This performance replaces
suggestion.

*Call the Storm (Su)*: At 18th level, a sea singer can use performance
to duplicate *[Control Water], [Control Weather], [Control Winds],* or *[Storm of Vengeance]*,
using his bard level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 1
round of continuous performance per level of the spell (as if he were a
druid). These effects continue for as long as the bard continues
performing (the effects on *control weather* happen immediately), but
not longer than the spell's normal duration. This performance replaces
mass suggestion.

**World Traveler (Ex)**: A sea singer gains a bonus equal to half his
bard level on [Knowledge]
(geography), [Knowledge]
(local), [Knowledge] (nature),
and [Linguistics] checks. He
can reroll a check against one of these skills, but must take the result
of the second roll even if it is worse. He can reroll one additional
time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. This ability
replaces bardic knowledge.

**Familiar**: At 2nd level, a sea singer acquires an exotic pet—a monkey
or parrot (treat as raven)—that gains abilities as a wizard's familiar,
using the sea singer's bard level as his wizard level. This ability
replaces versatile performance.

**Sea Legs (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a sea singer gains a +4 bonus on saving
throws against air and water effects and effects that would cause the
sea singer to slip, trip, or otherwise be knocked prone. He gains a +2
bonus to CMD against grapple, overrun, and trip. This ability replaces
well-versed.

### Street Performer

Whether acrobat, troubadour, or thespian, the street performer mixes
with the masses, singing for his supper.

**Bardic Performance**: A street performer gains the following types of
bardic performance.

*Disappearing Act (Su)*: A street performer can use performance to
divert attention from an ally. All creatures within 30 feet that fail a
Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) treat
one creature chosen by the bard as if it were *invisible*. This
performance affects one additional creature at 5th level and every 6
levels thereafter. If the targets take any action that would cause them
to become visible, they become visible to everyone. The bard cannot use
this ability on himself. This ability is a mind-affecting effect that
requires visual components. This performance replaces inspire courage.

*Harmless Performer (Su)*: At 3rd level, a street performer can use
performance to appear meek and unworthy of being attacked. While using
this performance, whenever an enemy targets the street performer, the
enemy must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the
bard's Cha bonus) or be unable to attack the bard this round, as per
*[Sanctuary]*. The enemy loses
the attack that targeted the bard, but may spend additional attacks
targeting other creatures. If the opponent was targeting the street
performer with a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check at the
same DC or lose the spell. If this check succeeds, it may target another
creature with the spell instead. This mind-affecting ability requires
audible or visual components. This performance replaces inspire
competence.

*Madcap Prank (Su)*: At 9th level, a street performer can use
performance to discomfit a target within 30 feet, causing its clothing
to become tangled, its headgear to fall down over its eyes, or even
causing it to slip and fall or otherwise be made to appear a fool. The
target must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the
bard's Cha modifier) each round that it hears or sees the performance,
or it takes one of the following random effects each round: 1—blinded,
2—dazzled, 3—deafened, 4—entangled, 5—fall prone, 6—nauseated. Each
effect lasts 1 round. This performance replaces inspire greatness.

*Slip through the Crowd (Su)*: At 15th level, a street performer's
disappearing act enables affected creatures to move through crowd
squares and enemy-occupied squares without impediment. Affected
creatures are treated as if having *[Greater Invisibility]*,
but enemies gain a new saving throw to notice them each time they are
attacked. This performance replaces inspire heroics.

**Gladhanding**: A street performer earns double the normal amount of
money from [Perform] checks. As a
standard action, he may use a [Bluff]
check in place of a [Diplomacy]
check to improve a creature's attitude for 1 minute, after which its
attitude becomes one step worse than originally. This ability replaces
countersong.

**Streetwise**: A street performer gains a bonus equal to half his level
on [Bluff],
[Disguise],
[Knowledge] (local), and
[Sleight of Hand]
checks, [Diplomacy] or
[Intimidate] checks made to
influence crowds, and
[Diplomacy] checks to gather
information (minimum +1). This replaces bardic knowledge.

**Quick Change (Ex)**: At 5th level, a street performer can don a
disguise as a standard action by taking a -5 penalty on his check. He
can take 10 on [Bluff] and
[Disguise] checks and use
[Bluff] to create a diversion to hide as
a swift action. He can take 20 on a
[Bluff] or
[Disguise] check once per day,
plus one time per six levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces lore
master.


## Cleric

Clerics are messengers and servants of the gods, venturing forth into
the world to spread their patrons' gospel through compassion, reason,
bargaining, or righteous conquest. They are the bearers of divine
guidance—and divine wrath. From gentle and penitent village priests to
holy warriors and church heads whose decrees can rock nations and foment
upheaval across entire worlds, clerics are everywhere, their callings
and methods as varied as the gods they serve. They are living proof of
the gods' power and interest in the world of mortals, and to deny them
is to invite destruction, both in this world and the next.

### Subdomains

Presented in the section below are new rules for subdomains—more
specific focuses for clerical worship and power that allow players
greater flexibility in customizing their characters. Every domain has a
number of subdomains associated with it (see [Table: Subdomains] for a complete list). Each
subdomain replaces a granted power and a number of spells in the
domain's granted spell list. Spells marked with an asterisk (\*) are
detailed in Chapter 5 of this book. A cleric who chooses a subdomain
must have access to both the domain and its subdomain from her deity. If
a cleric selects a subdomain, she cannot select its associated domain as
her other domain choice (in effect, the subdomain replaces its
associated domain). Subdomains are treated as equivalent to their
associated domain for any effect or prerequisite based on domains. If a
subdomain has two associated domains, the cleric can only select the
subdomain for one of her domains. Subdomains can be selected by Druids
(except the metal subdomain) and inquisitors (if their deity allows it).

If a subdomain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is
equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's cleric level + her Wisdom modifier.

  Domain        Subdomains
  ------------- ---------------------------
  Air           Cloud, Wind

## Druid

Druids are the keepers of the wildlands, the guardians watching at
nature's border to ensure that hubristic civilization does not overreach
its bounds. From the highest mountain peaks to the steaming jungles and
seas, druids learn and draw their power from their surrounding
environment and the creatures that live there. Like nature itself,
druids can be gentle and succoring or red in tooth and claw, and need
answer only to the wind and the rain.

Presented below are new variant class rules to help you customize your
druid for specific terrain types, as well as rules for druidic shamans
who worship specific totem animals.

### Aquatic Druid

Shepherds of the lakes and seas, aquatic druids guard ecosystems ranging
from shallows streams to deep ocean trenches, ministering to their
residents and communing with the tides.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)**: An aquatic druid's wild empathy functions only on
creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype;
however, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with
Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.

**Aquatic Adaptation (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an aquatic druid gains an
insight bonus on Initiative checks and
[Knowledge] (geography),
[Perception],
[Stealth],
[Survival], and
[Swim] checks equal to 1/2 her druid level
in aquatic terrain, and she cannot be tracked such environments. This
ability replaces woodland stride.

**Natural Swimmer (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an aquatic druid gains a swim
speed equal to half her land speed. This ability replaces trackless
step.

**Resist Ocean's Fury (Ex)**: At 4th level, an aquatic druid gains a +4
bonus on saving throws against spells of the water type or the
exceptional or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or
water subtype. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: An aquatic druid gains this ability at 6th level,
except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her
druid level - 2.

**Seaborn (Ex)**: At 9th level, an aquatic druid gains the aquatic
subtype, the amphibious trait, and a swim speed equal to her land speed.
She also can endure cold climate effects as if using *[Endure Elements]*. This
ability replaces venom immunity.

**Deep Diver (Ex)**: At 13th level, an aquatic druid gains DR/slashing
or piercing equal to 1/2 her level. This damage reduction also applies
against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling
or crushing (e.g., *[Black Tentacles]*,
*[Crushing Hand]*). She
never takes pressure damage from deep water. This ability replaces a
thousand faces.

### Arctic Druid

An arctic druid watches over the stark landscape of the far frozen
reaches of the world, tending the stunted and rugged life that ekes out
its survival in the least habitable climes.

**Arctic Native (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an arctic druid gains a bonus on
Initiative checks and
[Knowledge] (geography),
[Perception],
[Stealth], and
[Survival] checks equal to 1/2 her
druid level in cold or icy terrain, and she cannot be tracked in cold or
icy terrain. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Icewalking (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an arctic druid suffers no penalty to
speed or on [Acrobatics],
[Climb], or
[Stealth] checks in snowy or icy
terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin
ice without breaking through. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Arctic Endurance (Ex)**: At 4th level, an arctic druid ignores the
effects of a cold climate as if using *[Endure Elements]*. She is
also immune to being dazzled. This ability replaces resist nature's
lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: An arctic druid gains this ability at 6th level,
except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her
druid level - 2.

**Snowcaster (Su)**: At 9th level, an arctic druid can see normally in
*[Ice Storm]*, *[Sleet Storm]*, or similar natural
snowstorms. In addition, she can prepare any druid spell with the fire
subtype as a cold spell, with an identical effect but inflicting cold
damage instead of fire damage. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Flurry Form (Ex)**: At 13th level, an arctic druid can assume the form
of a swirling column of snow equivalent to *[Gaseous Form]* at will. While in
this form, she gains a circumstance bonus on
[Stealth] checks made in cold
terrain equal to her druid level. This ability replaces a thousand
faces.

### Blight Druid

The devoted servants of nature corrupted, ruined, and destroyed, blight
druids are the caretakers of lands ravaged by natural disaster. While
some are devoted to reforming and reclaiming lands despoiled by the
ravages of civilization, others seek out the more rapacious violence
inherent in nature and feed the creeping rot and decay that brings an
end to all things.

**Nature Bond (Ex)**: A blight druid may not bond with an animal
companion, but may either call a familiar as a wizard of her druid level
or select from the Darkness, Death, and Destruction domains in addition
to those normally available.

**Vermin Empathy (Su)**: A blight druid can improve the attitude of
vermin as a normal druid can with animals. Vermin have a starting
attitude of unfriendly. The blight druid can also improve the attitude
of animals and mindless undead creatures that were formerly animals, but
she takes a -4 penalty on the check unless the animal or undead has a
disease special attack. This ability replaces wild empathy.

**Miasma (Ex)**: Starting at 5th level, if a blight druid is adjacent to
a creature at the beginning of its turn, the creature must succeed at a
Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 the druid's level + the druid's
Wisdom modifier or become sickened for 1 round. A creature of the
animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is nauseated for 1 round
and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. If the creature makes its save, it
is immune to this effect for 24 hours, as are creatures immune to
disease. This ability replaces trackless step and resist nature's lure.

**Blightblooded (Ex)**: At 9th level, a blight druid gains immunity to
all diseases, including natural and supernatural diseases. She also
becomes immune to effects that would cause her to become sickened or
nauseated. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Plaguebearer (Su)**: Starting at 13th level, any creature that strikes
a blight druid with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural weapon
must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 the druid's level
+ the druid's Wisdom modifier or contract a disease, as the
*[Contagion]* spell. If the
creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This
ability replaces a thousand faces.

### Cave Druid

Far from the green fields of the world above lies a lightless expanse
beneath the surface. This darkling fairyland is not without beauty and
natural wonders of its own, and a few druids seek to preserve this
hidden realm and purge it of the fell horrors that creep up from below.

**Cavesense (Ex)**: A underground druid adds
[Knowledge] (dungeoneering)
rather than [Knowledge]
(geography) as a class skill and gains a +2 bonus on
[Knowledge] (dungeoneering) and
[Survival] skill checks. This
ability replaces the nature sense ability.

**Nature Bond**: A cave druid may select the Darkness domain in addition
to the choices normally allowed, but may not select the Air or Weather
domains.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)**: A cave druid can influence oozes, rather than
magical beasts, with a -4 penalty on her wild empathy check.

**Tunnelrunner (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a cave druid can move through areas
of rubble or narrow passages that require squeezing at her normal
movement rate and without penalty. This ability replaces woodland
stride.

**Lightfoot (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a cave druid cannot be detected with
tremorsense. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Resist Subterranean Corruption (Ex)**: At 4th level, a cave druid
gains a +2 bonus on saves against exceptional, supernatural, and
spell-like abilities of oozes and aberrations. This ability replaces
resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: A cave druid gains this ability at 6th level,
except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her
druid level - 2. She cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At
10th level, the cave druid can assume the form of a Small or Medium ooze
as if using *[Beast Shape III]*, and at 12th level
that of a Tiny or Large ooze as if using *[Beast Shape IV]*(treating the ooze as
if it were a magical beast without a natural armor bonus). When in ooze
form, the cave druid has no discernible anatomy and is immune to poison,
sneak attacks, and critical hits.

### Desert Druid

Not all climates are verdant paradises, but even in the sere deserts
there is life—though often hidden from the sun and rarely friendly—and
raw, desolate beauty. Here desert druids come to pay homage, protect and
maintain the few habitable locales, and witness nature's majesty in all
its burning, merciless glory.

**Desert Native (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a desert druid gains a bonus on
Initiative checks and
[Knowledge] (geography),
[Perception],
[Stealth], and
[Survival] checks equal to 1/2 her
druid level in desert terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such
environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.

speed or on [Acrobatics] or
[Stealth] checks when moving through
sandy or desert terrain. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Desert Endurance (Ex)**: At 4th level, a desert druid ignores the
effects of a hot climate as if using *[Endure Elements]*. She also
has a reduced need to eat and drink, as if wearing a *[Ring of Sustenance]* (though
normal sleep is still required). This ability replaces resist nature's
lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: A desert druid gains this ability at 6th level,
except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her
druid level - 2. A desert druid cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant
form. At 10th level she can assume the form of a Small or Medium vermin,
at 12th level a Tiny or Large vermin, and at 14th level a Diminutive or
Huge vermin. This effect functions as *[Beast Shape IV]* (treating the vermin
as an animal to determine its ability and natural armor modifiers).

**Shaded Vision (Ex)**: At 9th level, a desert druid becomes immune to
blinding and dazzling effects and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws
against gaze attacks and illusions of the figment and pattern
subschools. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Dunemeld (Ex)**: At 13th level, a desert druid can assume the form of
a swirling mass of sand at will. This is equivalent to *[Gaseous Form]*, but the druid gains
a land and burrow speed of 10 feet rather than a fly speed. While in
this form, the druid gains a circumstance bonus on
[Stealth] checks made in desert
terrain equal to her druid level. This ability replaces a thousand
faces.

### Jungle Druid

The fecund jungles of the equatorial regions are rich in life and
ancient tradition; druidical guardians of sacred pools, elder trees, and
trembling volcanoes watch over crumbling temples and the inevitable
reclamation of lost civilizations by the beating heart of nature
untamed.

**Jungle Guardian (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a jungle druid gains a bonus on
Initiative checks and [Climb],
[Knowledge] (geography),
[Perception],
[Stealth], and
[Survival] checks equal to 1/2 her
druid level in jungle terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such
environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.

level. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Torrid Endurance (Ex)**: At 4th level, a jungle druid ignores the
effects of a hot climate as if under the effects of *[Endure Elements]*. She also
gains a +4 bonus on saves against disease and the exceptional abilities
of animals and magical beasts. This ability replaces resist nature's
lure.

except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her
druid level - 2.

**Verdant Sentinel (Ex)**: At 13th level, a jungle druid can cast*[Tree Shape]* at will. This ability

### Mountain Druid

As more and more of the soft, easy lands become cultivated and
civilized, many druids look for refuge and solitude among the eternal
peaks of the highest mountains.

**Mountaineer (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a mountain druid gains a bonus on
Initiative checks and [Climb],
[Knowledge] (geography),
[Perception],
[Stealth], and
[Survival] checks equal to half
her druid level in mountainous terrain, and she cannot be tracked in
such an environment. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Sure-Footed (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a mountain druid suffers no penalty

[Stealth] checks when walking across
steep slopes, rubble, or scree. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Spire Walker (Ex)**: At 4th level, a mountain druid does not lose her
Dexterity bonus when climbing. A mountain druid is immune to altitude
sickness and ignores the effects of a cold climate as if under the
effects of *[Endure Elements]*. This
ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: A mountain druid gains this ability at 6th level,
except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her
druid level - 2. A mountain druid cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant
form. However, at 12th level she can assume the form of a Large giant as
if using *[Giant Form I]*. At
16th level, she may assume the form of a Huge giant as if using *[Giant
Form II]*.

**Mountain Stance (Ex)**: At 9th level, a mountain druid gains immunity
to petrification and receives a +4 bonus on saving throws or to CMD to
resist any attempt to push, pull, bull rush, or drag her, or to resist
any other effect that would physically move her from her position (e.g.,
*[Repel Wood], [Reverse Gravity],* or being
blown away by high winds). This does not protect her against being
tripped, grappled, or overrun. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Mountain Stone (Ex)**: At 13th level, a mountain druid can transform
her body into a weathered stone outcrop and back at will. This effect
functions as *[Statue]*. This ability
replaces a thousand faces.

### Plains Druid

Out upon the wide and rolling prairies and savannahs, plains druids
stand guard over the grasslands. These druids range far and wide,
watching over nomadic tribes and wandering herds and preserving the
sometimes fragile ecosystem of the wide open spaces.

**Plains Traveler (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a plains druid gains a bonus on
initiative checks and
[Knowledge] (geography),
[Perception],

**Run Like the Wind (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a plains druid gains +10 feet
to her land speed when wearing light or no armor and carrying a light
load, and once per hour, she may run or charge at double the normal

instead. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Savanna Ambush (Ex)**: At 4th level, a plains druid gains concealment
whenever she is prone in natural surroundings, and can make
[Stealth] checks at no penalty when
prone and not moving or at -5 when crawling. A plains druid can stand up
from prone as an immediate action during a surprise round. This ability
replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: A plains druid gains this ability at 6th level,
except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her
druid level - 2.

**Canny Charger (Ex)**: At 9th level, a plains druid can charge through
allies' squares without difficulty (whether mounted or afoot) and can
turn up to 90 degrees once during a charge, provided the last 10 feet
toward the target are in a straight line. She also gains a +4 dodge
bonus to AC against enemy charge attacks and a +4 bonus to damage with a
readied action against a charging foe. This ability replaces venom
immunity.

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 13th level, a plains druid gains evasion when
wearing light or no armor and carrying a light load. This functions as
the rogue ability of the same name. This ability replaces a thousand
faces.

### Swamp Druid

Some druids eschew pleasant glades and groves and instead seek out dank
marshes, misty bogs and heaths, and trackless swamps as the place they
call home and watch over with care, finding beauty and life in abundance
in places few others would willingly enter.

**Marshwight (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a swamp druid gains a bonus on
Initiative checks and
[Knowledge] (geography),
[Perception],
[Stealth],
[Swim], and
[Survival] checks equal to 1/2 her

saves against disease and the exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like
abilities of monstrous humanoids. A swamp druid also gains DR/— equal to
half her druid level against attacks by swarms. If this damage
resistance prevents damage, the druid is unaffected by distraction or
other special attacks of the swarm. This ability replaces resist
nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: A swamp druid gains this ability at 6th level,
except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her
druid level - 2.

**Slippery (Ex)**: At 13th level, a swamp druid gains continuous
*[Freedom of Movement]*.
This ability replaces a thousand faces.

### Urban Druid

While many druids keep to the wilderness, some make their way within
settlements, communing with the animals and vermin who live there and
speaking for the nature that runs rampant in civilization's very cradle.

**Spontaneous Casting**: An urban druid can channel stored spell energy
into domain spells that she has not prepared ahead of time. She can
“lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any domain spell of the same
level or lower. This ability replaces the ability to spontaneously cast
summon nature's ally spells.

**Nature Bond (Ex)**: An urban druid may not select an animal companion.
Instead, she must choose from the following domains, rather than those
usually available to druids: Charm, Community, Knowledge, Nobility,
Protection, Repose, Rune, or Weather.

**Lorekeeper (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an urban druid adds
[Diplomacy],
[Knowledge] (history),
[Knowledge] (local), and
[Knowledge] (nobility) skills to
her list of class skills. She also receives a +2 bonus on these skill
checks. This ability replaces a druid's woodland stride and trackless
step abilities.

**Resist Temptation (Ex)**: At 4th level, an urban druid gains a +2
bonus on saves vs. divinations and enchantments. This replaces the
resist nature's lure ability.

except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her
druid level - 4.

**Mental Strength (Ex)**: At 9th level, an urban druid gains immunity to
charm and compulsion effects. This ability replaces venom immunity.

### Animal Shamans

Some druids form a close bond with one type of animal. The following
animal shamans represent just some of the possibilities, exploring the
unique bond between a druid and her totem. These shamans all possess
similar powers, which are explained fully in the bear shaman
description.

#### Bear Shaman

A shaman with this focus calls upon the mighty bear, titan of the
woodlands and mountains, a paragon of strength and ferocity, and yet
also a quiet protector rich in wisdom.

**Nature Bond**: A bear shaman who chooses an animal companion must
select a bear. If choosing a domain, the bear shaman must choose from
the Animal, Earth, Protection, and Strength domains.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)**: A bear shaman can use wild empathy with bears and
wolverines as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.

**Totem Transformation (Su)**: At 2nd level, a bear shaman may adopt an

(low-light vision, scent), toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC,
[Endurance] feat), or natural weapons (bite
[1d6] and 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium shaman, +2 to CMB on grapple
checks). While using totem transformation, the bear shaman may speak
normally and can cast *[Speak with Animals]*
(mammals only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd
level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The
bear shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal
to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but
they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and
cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such
as wild shape.

**Totemic Summons (Su)**: At 5th level, a bear shaman may cast *summon
nature's ally* as a standard action when summoning bears, and summoned
bears gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply
the young template to any bear to reduce the level of the summoning
spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning
required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant
template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant
templates. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: At 6th level, a bear shaman's wild shape ability
functions at her druid level - 2. If she takes on the form of a bear,
she instead uses her druid level + 2.

shaman gains one of the following bonus feats:
[Diehard],
[Endurance], [Great Fortitude], [Improved Great Fortitude],
[Toughness]. She must meet the

an aspect of the eagle while retaining her normal form. This ability
functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the
following bonuses: movement (fly speed 30 feet [Average], the druid must
be 5th level to select this bonus), senses (low-light vision, +4 racial
bonus to [Perception]), or
natural weapons (bite [1d4], 2 talons [1d4] for a Medium shaman). While
using totem transformation, the eagle shaman may speak normally and can
cast *[speak with animals]* (birds
only) at will.

**Totemic Summons (Su)**: At 5th level, an eagle shaman may cast *summon
nature's ally* as a standard action when summoning eagles, rocs, and
giant eagles (added to the 4th-level list), and these summoned creatures
gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability
otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: At 6th level, an eagle shaman's wild shape ability
functions at her druid level - 2. If she takes on the form of an eagle
or roc, she instead uses her druid level + 2.

**Bonus Feat**: At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, an eagle
shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: [Flyby Attack], [Improved
Lightning Reflexes],
[Lightning Reflexes], [Skill Focus]
([Perception]), or [Wind Stance]. She must meet the prerequisites
for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.

#### Lion Shaman

A shaman with this totem calls upon the proud lion, imposing and
majestic, the mighty leader of deadly hunters.

select a lion. If choosing a domain, the lion shaman must choose from
the Animal, Glory, Nobility, and Sun domains.

as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.

senses (low-light vision, scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4], 2
claws [1d4] for a Medium druid, rake, +2 CMB to grapple). While using

*[speak with animals]*
(felines only) at will.

**Totemic Summons (Su)**: At 5th level, a lion shaman may cast *summon
nature's ally* as a standard action when summoning felines, and these
summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level.
This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.

shaman gains one of the following bonus feats:
[Dodge],
[Improved Iron Will], [Iron Will], or [Skill Focus]
([Acrobatics]). She must meet
the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom
immunity.

#### Serpent Shaman

A shaman with this totem calls upon the cunning serpent, the stealthy
deceiver who draws the weak minded in and strikes while they are
unaware. Some hate its treacherous nature, while others praise its
thoughtful pragmatism.

select a snake. If choosing a domain, the serpent shaman must choose

reptiles as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.

**Totem Transformation (Su)**: At 2nd level, a serpent shaman may adopt

or natural weapons (bite [1d4], poison [*frequency*1 round (6), *effect*
1 Con damage, *Cure*1 save, Con-based DC] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to
grapple). While using totem transformation, the serpent shaman may speak
normally and can cast *[Speak with Animals]*
(reptiles only) at will.

**Totemic Summons (Su)**: At 5th level, a serpent shaman may cast
*summon nature's ally* as a standard action when summoning snakes, and

select a wolf. If choosing a domain, the wolf shaman must choose from
the Animal, Community, Liberation, and Travel domains.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)**: A wolf shaman can use wild empathy with canines
as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.

**Totem Transformation (Su)**: At 2nd level, a wolf shaman may adopt an

following bonuses: movement (+20 enhancement bonus to land speed),
senses (low-light vision, scent, +4 racial bonus to
[Survival] when tracking by
scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4 plus trip] for a Medium druid, +2

speak normally and can cast *[Speak with Animals]*
(canines only) at will.

## Fighter

From dockside brawlers to legendary champions, poor foot soldiers to the
greatest duelists of the nobility, fighters are those who devote
themselves wholeheartedly to the art of combat. While barbarians tap
into raw fury in battle, fighters know that the mind is the keenest
weapon, and they use theirs to great effect, mastering numerous
armaments and fighting styles in a never-ending quest to be the last
warrior standing.

Presented below are a number of common martial themes, complete with
variant class abilities to help customize characters to their chosen
fighting style.

### Archer

The archer is dedicated to the careful mastery of the bow, perfecting
his skills with years of practice honed day after day on ranges and
hunting for game, or else on the battlefield, raining destruction down
on the enemy lines.

**Hawkeye (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on
[Perception] checks, and the
range increment for any bow he uses increases by 5 feet. These bonuses
increase by +1 and 5 additional feet for every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This
ability replaces bravery.

**Trick Shot (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an archer can choose one of the
following combat maneuvers or actions: disarm, feint, or sunder. He can
perform this action with a bow against any target within 30 feet, with a
-4 penalty to his CMB. Every four levels beyond 3rd, he may choose an
additional trick shot to learn. These maneuvers use up arrows as normal.

At 11th level, he may also choose from the following combat maneuvers:
bull rush, grapple, trip. A target grappled by an arrow can break free
by destroying the archer's arrow (hardness 5, hit points 1, break DC 13)
or with an [Escape Artist] or CMB check
(against the archer's CMD -4). This ability replaces armor training 1,
2, 3, and 4.

**Expert Archer (Ex)**: At 5th level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on
attack and damage rolls with bows. This bonus increases by +1 for every
four levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.

**Safe Shot (Ex)**: At 9th level, an archer does not provoke attacks of
opportunity when making ranged attacks with a bow. This ability replaces
weapon training 2.

**Evasive Archer (Ex)**: At 13th level, an archer gains a +2 dodge bonus
to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 17th level.
This ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Volley (Ex)**: At 17th level, as a full-round action, an archer can
make a single bow attack at his highest base attack bonus against any
number of creatures in a 15-foot- radius burst, making separate attack
and damage rolls for each creature. This ability replaces weapon
training 4.

**Ranged Defense (Ex)**: At 19th level, an archer gains DR 5/— against
ranged attacks. In addition, as an immediate action, he can catch an
arrow fired at him and shoot it any target he chooses, as if he had the
[Snatch Arrows] feat. This ability
replaces armor mastery.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)**: An archer must choose a type of bow.

### Crossbowman

The crossbowman has perfected the deadly use of the crossbow, a simple
but cruelly efficient weapon, as a craftsman mastering a lethal tool.

**Deadshot (Ex)**: At 3rd level, when a crossbowman attacks with a
crossbow as a readied action, he may add 1/2 his Dexterity bonus
(minimum +1) on his damage roll. This ability replaces armor training 1.

on attack and damage rolls with crossbows. This bonus increases by +1
per four levels after 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.

bonus to its AC. This ability replaces armor training 2.

with a crossbow as a readied action, he may add his Dexterity bonus
(minimum +1) on his damage roll. This ability replaces armor training 3.

attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with a crossbow. This
ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Pinpoint Targeting**: At 15th level, a crossbowman gains[Pinpoint Targeting] as a bonus feat. This
ability replaces armor training 4.

**Meteor Shot (Ex)**: At 17th level, as a standard action, a crossbowman
can make one attack with a crossbow at a -4 penalty. If the attack hits,
it inflicts damage normally and the target is subject to a bull rush or
a trip maneuver using the attack roll as the combat maneuver check. The
crossbowman must decide which maneuver to attempt before making his
attack roll. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

**Penetrating Shot (Ex)**: At 19th level, when a crossbowman confirms a
critical hit with a crossbow, the bolt pierces the target and can strike
another creature in line behind it. The crossbowman must be able to
trace a line starting at his space and passing through both targets to
make this additional attack. The secondary attack is made at a -4
penalty, in addition to any modifiers for added range. If this attack is
also a critical hit, the bolt can continue to hit another target, but
the penalties stack. This ability replaces armor mastery.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)**: A crossbowman must choose a type of crossbow.

### Free Hand Fighter

The free hand fighter specializes in the delicate art of handling a
single weapon in one hand while using his free hand to balance, block,
tip, and distract his opponents. While not a brawler, his open hand is
as much a weapon as a bow or blade. His fighting school benefits only
apply when he is using a one-handed weapon and carrying nothing in his
other hand.

**Deceptive Strike (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a free hand fighter gains a +1
bonus to CMB and CMD on disarm checks and on
[Bluff] checks to feint or create a
diversion to hide. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels
after 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Elusive (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a free hand fighter gains a +1 dodge
bonus to AC. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd.
This bonus does not apply when wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying
a medium or heavier load. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3,
and 4.

**Singleton (Ex)**: At 5th level, a free hand fighter gains a +1 bonus
on attack and damage rolls when wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
leaving his other hand free. This bonus increases by +1 per six levels
after 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1 and 4.

**Timely Tip (Ex)**: At 9th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm
combat maneuver against a target he threatens as a move action to push
aside the target's shield. If successful, the target loses its shield
bonus to AC against the free hand fighter's next attack. This ability
replaces weapon training 2.

**Interference (Ex)**: At 13th level, a free hand fighter can make a
disarm or trip combat maneuver against a target he threatens as a move
action to push his opponent off balance. If successful, the target
becomes flat-footed. This condition lasts until the target takes damage
from a melee or ranged attack or until the beginning of the free hand
fighter's next turn, whichever comes first. This ability replaces weapon
training 3.

**Reversal (Ex)**: At 19th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm
combat maneuver against a creature he threatens as an immediate action
when he is the target of a melee attack from another creature. If
successful, the attack changes to target the target of the free hand
fighter's maneuver instead of the free hand fighter himself. This
ability replaces armor mastery.

### Mobile Fighter

Where some fighters focus on strength and raw power, the mobile fighter
relies on swiftness and mobility, gliding across the battlefield like a
steel whirlwind and leaving destruction in his wake.

**Agility (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a mobile fighter gains a +1 bonus on
saving throws made against effects that cause him to become paralyzed,
slowed, or entangled. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels
beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Leaping Attack (Ex)**: At 5th level, when a mobile fighter moves at
least 5 feet prior to attacking, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and
damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond
5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Rapid Attack (Ex)**: At 11th level, a mobile fighter can combine a
full attack action with a single move. He must forgo the attack at his
highest bonus but may take the remaining attacks at any point during his
movement. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. This
ability replaces armor training 3.

**[Fleet] Footed (Ex)**: At 15th level, the
mobile fighter's speed increases by 10 feet. He can take 10 on
[Acrobatics] checks even while
distracted or threatened, and can take 20 on an
[Acrobatics] check once per
day for every five fighter levels he possesses. This ability replaces
armor training 4.

**Whirlwind Blitz (Ex)**: At 20th level, a mobile fighter can make a
full-attack action as a standard action. He may also use the [Whirlwind Attack] feat as a standard action.
This ability replaces weapon mastery.

### Phalanx Soldier

The phalanx soldier specializes in defensive tactics, using his shield
to guard himself and his allies and forming a shield wall like an
unbreakable anvil against which his enemies break.

**Stand Firm (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a phalanx soldier gains a +1 bonus to
CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. This bonus also
applies on saves against trample attacks. The bonus increases by +1 for
every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Phalanx Fighting (Ex)**: At 3rd level, when a phalanx soldier wields a
shield, he can use any polearm or spear of his size as a one-handed
weapon. This ability replaces armor training 1.

**Ready Pike (Ex)**: At 5th level, a phalanx soldier can, once per day,
ready a weapon with the brace property as an immediate action, gaining a
+1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. For every four levels beyond 5th,
this bonus increases by +1, and he can use the ability one additional
time per day. He cannot use this ability when flat-footed. This ability
replaces weapon training 1.

**Deft Shield (Ex)**: At 7th level, the armor check penalty from a
shield and the attack roll penalty are reduced by -1 for a phalanx
soldier using a tower shield. At 11th level, these penalties are reduced
by -2. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 3.

**Shield Ally (Ex)**: At 9th level, when a phalanx fighter is using a
heavy or tower shield, he can, as a move action, provide partial cover
(+2 cover bonus to AC, +1 bonus on Reflex saves) to himself and all
adjacent allies until the beginning of his next turn.

At 13th level, he can instead provide cover (+4 cover bonus to AC, +2
bonus on Reflex saves) and evasion (as a rogue) to one adjacent ally
until the beginning of his next turn. This cover does not allow
[Stealth] checks.

At 17th level, he can provide cover to himself and all adjacent allies,
or he can provide improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on
Reflex saves, improved evasion) to a single adjacent ally. This ability
replaces weapon training 2, 3, and 4.

**Irresistible Advance (Ex)**: At 15th level, a phalanx fighter gains a
bonus on bull rush and overrun CMB checks. This bonus depends on the
type of shield used: +1 with a buckler, +2 with a light shield, +3 with
a heavy shield, or +4 with a tower shield. This ability replaces armor
training 4.

**Shielded Fortress (Ex)**: At 20th level, a phalanx fighter's shield
cannot be disarmed or sundered. He gains evasion (as a rogue) when using
a shield (improved evasion when using a tower shield). As a move action,
a phalanx fighter can provide evasion to all adjacent allies until the
beginning of his next turn. As an immediate action, he can provide
improved evasion to an adjacent ally against one attack. This ability
replaces weapon mastery.

### Polearm Master

The polearm master is schooled in the ancient wisdom that enemies are
best faced at the end of long striking pole, lashing like a serpent
before clumsy swords and axes can even be brought to bear.

**Pole Fighting (Ex)**: At 2nd level, as an immediate action, a polearm
master can shorten the grip on his spear or polearm with reach and use
it against adjacent targets. This action results in a -4 penalty on
attack rolls with that weapon until he spends another immediate action
to return to the normal grip. The penalty is reduced by -1 for every
four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Steadfast Pike (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a polearm master gains a +1 bonus
on attack rolls with readied attacks and attacks of opportunity made
with a spear or polearm. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels
beyond 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Polearm Training (Ex)**: At 5th level, a polearm master gains a +1
bonus on attack and damage rolls with spears and polearms. The bonus
increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces
weapon training 1.

**Flexible Flanker (Ex)**: At 9th level, a polearm master may choose any
square adjacent to him and treat that square as his location for
determining who he is flanking, even if that square is occupied by a
creature, object, or solid barrier. This ability replaces weapon
training 2.

**Sweeping Fend (Ex)**: At 13th level, a polearm master can use any
spear or pole arm to make a bull rush or trip maneuver, though he takes
a -4 penalty to his CMB when making such attempts. Weapons with the trip
property do not incur this penalty on trip maneuvers. This ability
replaces weapon training 3.

**Step Aside (Ex)**: At 17th level, when a creature threatened by a
polearm master takes a 5-foot step into a square adjacent to him, he can
take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. This 5-foot step must be
subtracted from his movement on the next turn. He also gains a +2 dodge
bonus to his AC against that opponent until the end of his next turn.
This ability replaces weapon training 4.

**Polearm Parry (Ex)**: At 19th level, when an opponent threatened by a
polearm master makes a melee attack against an ally, he may take an
immediate action to grant his ally a +2 shield bonus to AC and DR 5/—
against that attack. He may use this ability to protect himself, but
only if the attacking creature is not adjacent to him. This ability
replaces armor mastery.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)**: A polearm master must choose a spear or
polearm.

### Roughrider

Roughriders study and practice the fine points of mounted combat,
drilling endlessly with warbeasts—from noble thoroughbreds to trained
monsters—to form a perfect synergy between rider and steed.

**Steadfast Mount (Ex)**: At 2nd level, after a roughrider has spent 1
hour practicing with a mount, the mount gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and
a +1 morale bonus on saves, but only while the roughrider is mounted on
it or adjacent to it. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels
after 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Armored Charger (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a roughrider no longer suffers
armor check penalties on [Ride] skill
checks. His mount's speed is not reduced when carrying a medium load or
wearing medium barding. This ability replaces armor training 1.

**Mounted Mettle (Ex)**: At 5th level, a roughrider and his mount gain a
+1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when he is mounted or adjacent to
his mount. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 5th.
This ability replaces weapon training 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Leap from the Saddle (Ex)**: At 7th level, after a roughrider's mount
takes a single move, he may attempt a fast dismount (DC 20
[Ride] check). If he succeeds, he can take
a full attack action. This ability replaces armor training 2.

**Relentless Steed (Ex)**: At 11th level, a roughrider's mount does not
reduce its speed when wearing heavy barding or carrying a heavy load.
The roughrider may also reroll a [Ride]
skill check or a saving throw made by the mount once per day, but must
use the second roll even if it is worse. This ability may be used one
additional time per day for every four levels beyond 11th. This ability
replaces armor training 3.

**[Ride] Them Down (Ex)**: At 15th level,
can spur his mount on while readying an attack. If a roughrider's mount
takes a single move, the roughrider can make a full attack, taking his
attacks at any point during his mount's movement. If he has the
[Trample] feat, he may substitute an overrun
combat maneuver for each of his attacks. This movement provokes attacks
of opportunity against the roughrider but not his mount. This ability
replaces armor training 4.

**Unavoidable Onslaught (Ex)**: At 15th level, a roughrider's mounted
charge is not blocked by friendly creatures or difficult terrain. This
ability replaces armor training 4.

**Indomitable Steed (Ex)**: At 19th level, a roughrider and his steed
gain DR 5/— when mounted. This ability replaces armor mastery.

### Savage Warrior

Warriors' might is not measured only by their skill with steel, but also
by their ability to inflict death with fang and claw, horn and hoof, and
every exotic appendage the natural and unnatural world has to offer.

**Spark of Life (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a savage warrior gains a +1 bonus
on saving throws made against energy drain and death effects. This bonus
increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces
bravery.

**Natural Savagery (Ex)**: At 5th level, a savage warrior gains a +1
bonus on attack and damage rolls with natural weapons. This bonus also
applies to CMB and CMD for grappling. This bonus increases by +1 for
every four levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.

**Savage Charge (Ex)**: At 9th level, when a savage warrior attacks with
a natural weapon at the end of a charge, he gains a bonus on his natural
weapon attack rolls equal to half his fighter level, while suffering a
penalty to his AC equal to half his fighter level. These replace the
normal attack roll bonus and AC penalty for charging. This bonus also
applies to his CMB for a bull rush or overrun combat maneuvers made when
charging. This ability replaces weapon training 2.

**Careful Claw (Ex)**: At 13th level, when using a natural weapon to
attack a creature using *[Fire Shield]* or a similar effect
that damages creatures attacking it (such as a barbed devil's barbed
defense), a savage warrior reduces the damage from such effects by an
amount equal to 1/2 his fighter level. This ability replaces weapon
training 3.

**Greater Savage Charge (Ex)**: At 17th level, when using savage charge,
the AC penalty is reduced to 1/4 his fighter level instead of 1/2 his
fighter level. In addition, a savage warrior can charge through friendly
creatures and difficult terrain. This ability replaces weapon training
4.

**Natural Weapon Mastery (Ex)**: At 20th level, a savage warrior must
choose one natural weapon. This ability replaces weapon mastery.

### Shielded Fighter

A shielded fighter focuses on both offense and defense, blending weapon
and shield in perfect balance to impede his enemies while delivering
deadly blows, and even turning the shield itself into a formidable
weapon. These fighting school benefits apply when wielding a weapon and
a shield simultaneously.

**Active Defense (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a shielded fighter gains a +1
dodge bonus to AC when wielding a shield and fighting defensively, using
[Combat Expertise], or using total
defense. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. As
a swift action, he may share this bonus with one adjacent ally, or half
of the bonus (minimum +0) with all adjacent allies, until the beginning
of his next turn. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Shield Fighter (Ex)**: At 5th level, a shielded fighter gains a +1
bonus on attack and damage rolls when making a shield bash. These
bonuses increase by +1 every four levels beyond 5th. With a full attack
action, a shielded fighter may alternate between using his weapon or his
shield for each attack. This action does not grant additional attacks or
incur penalties as two-weapon fighting does. This ability replaces
weapon training 1.

**Shield Buffet (Ex)**: At 9th level, as a move action, a shielded
fighter may make a combat maneuver check to use his shield to impede an
adjacent enemy. If successful, the target suffers a -2 penalty on its
attack rolls against the shielded fighter and a -2 penalty to AC on
attacks made by the shielded fighter until the beginning of his next
turn.

At 13th level, a shielded fighter may use this ability as a swift
action. This ability replaces weapon training 2 and 3.

**Shield Guard (Ex)**: At 17th level, as a swift action, a shielded
fighter may designate one square adjacent to him. He may designate two
squares if using a heavy shield or three squares if using a tower
shield, but these squares must be contiguous. Enemies in these squares
cannot flank the shielded fighter and do not count for flanking with
other creatures. This effect lasts until he moves from his position or
uses another swift action to change the affected squares. This ability
replaces weapon training 4.

**Shield Mastery (Ex)**: At 19th level, a shielded fighter gains DR 5/—
when wielding a shield. This ability replaces armor mastery.

**Shield Ward (Ex)**: At 20th level, a shielded fighter gains evasion
(as a rogue) while wielding a shield, and adds his shield bonus to his
AC (not including enhancement bonuses) on Reflex saves and to his touch
AC. In addition, his shield cannot be disarmed or sundered. This ability
replaces weapon mastery.

### Two-Handed Fighter

Some fighters focus their efforts on finding the biggest, heaviest, most
imposing weapon they can find and training to manage and harness the
weight of their massive weapons for maximum impact. These fighting
school benefits only apply when using two-handed weapons.

**Shattering Strike (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a two-handed fighter gains a
+1 bonus to CMB and CMD on sunder attempts and on damage rolls made
against objects. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four levels
beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Overhand Chop (Ex)**: At 3rd level, when a two-handed fighter makes a
single attack (with the attack action or a charge) with a two-handed
weapon, he adds double his Strength bonus on damage rolls. This ability
replaces armor training 1.

**Weapon Training (Ex)**: As the fighter class feature, but the bonuses
only apply when wielding two-handed melee weapons.

**Backswing (Ex)**: At 7th level, when a two-handed fighter makes a full
attack with a two-handed weapon, he adds double his Strength bonus on
damage rolls for all attacks after the first. This ability replaces
armor training 2.

**Piledriver (Ex)**: At 11th level, as a standard action, a two-handed
fighter can make a single melee attack with a two-handed weapon. If the
attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the
target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. This ability replaces armor training 3.

**Greater [Power Attack] (Ex)**: At 15th
level, when using [Power Attack] with a
two-handed melee weapon, the bonus damage from [Power Attack] is doubled (+100%) instead of
increased by half (+50%). This ability replaces armor training 4.

**Devastating Blow (Ex)**: At 19th level, as a standard action, a
two-handed fighter may make a single melee attack with a two-handed
weapon at a -5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical
threat. Special weapon abilities that activate only on a critical hit do
not activate if this critical hit is confirmed. This ability replaces
armor mastery.

### Two-Weapon Warrior

Trained under great masters who preached the simple truth that two are
better than one when it comes to weapons, the two-weapon warrior is a
terror when his hands are full. From paired daggers to exotic double
weapons, all combinations come equally alive in his skilled hands.

**Defensive Flurry (Ex)**: At 3rd level, when a two-weapon warrior makes
a full attack with both weapons, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against
melee attacks until the beginning of his next turn. This bonus increases
by +1 every four levels after 3rd. This ability replaces armor training
1 and 2.

**Twin Blades (Ex)**: At 5th level, a two-weapon warrior gains a +1
bonus on attack and damage rolls when making a full attack with two
weapons or a double weapon. This bonus increases by +1 for every four
levels after 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.

**Doublestrike (Ex)**: At 9th level, a two-weapon warrior may, as a
standard action, make one attack with both his primary and secondary
weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally.
This ability replaces weapon training 2.

**Improved Balance (Ex)**: At 11th level, the attack penalties for
fighting with two weapons are reduced by -1 for a two-weapon warrior.
Alternatively, he may use a one-handed weapon in his off-hand, treating
it as if it were a light weapon with the normal light weapon penalties.
This ability replaces armor training 3.

**Equal Opportunity (Ex)**: At 13th level, when a two-weapon warrior
makes an attack of opportunity, he may attack once with both his primary
and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons
apply normally. This ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Perfect Balance (Ex)**: At 15th level, the penalties for fighting with
two weapons are reduced by an additional -1 for a two-weapon warrior.
This benefit stacks with improved balance. If he is using a one-handed
weapon in his off hand, treating it as a light weapon, he uses the
normal light weapon penalties. This ability replaces armor training 4.

**Deft Doublestrike (Ex)**: At 17th level, when a two-weapon warrior
hits an opponent with both weapons, he can make a disarm or sunder
attempt (or trip, if one or both weapons can be used to trip) against
that opponent as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

**Deadly Defense (Ex)**: At 19th level, when a two-weapon warrior makes
a full attack with both weapons, every creature that hits him with a
melee attack before the beginning of his next turn provokes an attack of
opportunity from the warrior. This ability replaces armor mastery.

### Weapon Master

Devoted to the perfection of a single weapon, the weapon master's
meditations upon his favored weapon border on the obsessive, but none
can deny his consummate skill. The weapon master must select a single
type of weapon (such as longsword or shortbow). All of his abilities
apply to that weapon type.

**Weapon Guard (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a weapon master gains a +1 bonus to
CMD against disarm and sunder attempts while wielding his chosen weapon.
This bonus also applies on saves against any effect that targets his
chosen weapon (for example, *[Grease],
[Heat Metal],
[Shatter], [Warp Wood]*). The bonus increases by
+1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Weapon Training (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a weapon master gains a +1 bonus
on attack and damage rolls with his chosen weapon. The bonus improves by
+1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces armor
training 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Reliable Strike (Ex)**: At 5th level, a weapon master may reroll an
attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, miss chance check, or
damage roll as an immediate action. He must accept the second roll even
if it is worse. He can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus
one additional time per day for every five levels beyond 5th. This
ability replaces weapon training 1.

**Mirror Move (Ex)**: At 9th level, a weapon master gains his weapon
training bonus as an insight bonus to AC when attacked by his chosen
weapon. This ability replaces weapon training 2.

**Deadly Critical (Ex)**: At 13th level, when a weapon master confirms a
critical hit with his chosen weapon, he can increase the weapon's damage
multiplier by +1 as an immediate action. He can use this ability once
per day at 13th level, plus one additional time per day for every three
levels above 13th. This ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Critical Specialist (Ex)**: At 17th level, the save DCs of any effects
caused by a critical hit with a weapon master's chosen weapon increase
by +4. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

**Unstoppable Strike (Ex)**: At 19th level, a weapon master can take a
standard action to make one attack with his chosen weapon as a touch
attack that ignores damage reduction (or hardness, if attacking an
object). This ability replaces armor mastery.


## Monk

Monks are martial mystics. Through mediation and discipline, and
sometimes by way of secrets passed down for generations within a
monastery, a monk progresses toward his perfect self—along the way
turning his body into an astonishing fighting machine. But though some
masters would lead their students to think otherwise, the path toward
the perfect self isn't set. Different monks confront the road to
enlightenment in different ways, and sometimes even with different
goals, from harmony with the universe to physical perfection and
immortality.

The themes and alternate class features presented below introduce not
only variations in fighting techniques, but alternate philosophies for
monks seeking perfection.

Bonus feats marked with asterisks (\*) are found in the feat section of
this book.

### Drunken Master

Most monks lead lives of moderation and quiet contemplation. But the
drunken master finds perfection through excess. Powered by strong wine,
he uses his intoxication to reach a state where his *ki* is more potent,
if somewhat fleeting. A drunken master has the following class features.

**Drunken *Ki* (Su)**: At 3rd level, a drunken master can drink a
tankard of ale or strong alcohol and gain one temporary *ki* point. The
act of drinking is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. The monk can have a maximum number of drunken *ki* points
equal to 1 plus one additional point for every two levels thereafter
(5th, 7th, and so on). The monk can gain this temporary *ki* even before
he gains a *ki* pool at 4th level. These drunken *ki* points last for 1
hour or until spent, whichever is shorter. As long as he has at least 1
drunken *ki* point, the monk can spend 1 *ki* point as a swift action to
move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability
replaces still mind.

**Drunken Strength (Su)**: At 5th level, a drunken master can spend 1
point of *ki* as a swift action to inflict 1d6 extra points of damage on
a single successful melee attack. The monk can choose to apply the
damage after the attack roll is made. At 10th level, the monk may spend
2 drunken *ki* points to increase the extra damage to 2d6. At 15th
level, the monk may spend 3 drunken *ki* points to increase the extra
damage to 3d6. At 20th level, the monk may spend 4 drunken *ki* points
to increase the extra damage to 4d6. The monk must have at least 1
drunken *ki* point to use this ability. This ability replaces purity of
body.

**Drunken Courage (Su)**: At 11th level, a drunken master is immune to
fear as long as he has at least 1 point of drunken *ki*. This ability
replaces diamond body.

**Drunken Resilience (Ex)**: At 13th level, a drunken master gains DR
1/— as long as he has at least 1 point of drunken *ki*. At 16th level,
the DR increases to 2/—. At 19th level, it increases to 3/—. This
ability replaces diamond soul.

**Firewater Breath (Su)**: At 19th level, a drunken master can take a
drink and expel a gout of alcohol-fueled fire in a 30-foot cone.
Creatures within the cone take 20d6 points of fire damage. A successful
Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis
modifier) halves the damage. Using this ability is a standard action
that consumes 4 *ki* points from the monk's *ki* pool. The monk must
have at least 1 drunken *ki* point to use this ability. This ability
replaces empty body.

### Hungry Ghost Monk

The hungry ghost monk looks to spirits that prey upon the living as
models of perfection. He sees the life energy of the universe as a
resource to be manipulated, even stealing it from other creatures. It is
through this constant influx of energy that the hungry ghost monk
reaches his ultimate goal: power—personal, pure, and simple. A hungry
ghost monk has the following class features.

**[Punishing Kick])
(Ex)**: At 1st level, a hungry ghost monk gains [Punishing Kick]) as a bonus feat,
even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 10th level, and every
five levels thereafter, the monk can push the target of his [Punishing Kick]) an additional 5
feet (10 feet at 10th level, 15 feet at 15th level, and 20 feet at 20th
level). At 15th level, he can instead choose to push the target 5 feet
and knock the target prone with the same attack. The target still gets a
saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. This ability replaces
[Stunning Fist].

**Steal *Ki* (Ex)**: At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal *ki*
from other creatures, though this ability is controversial in some
circles of monks, who see it as nothing less than a form of vampirism.
If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or
reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of
that creature's*ki*. This ability replenishes 1 spent *ki* point to the
monk's *ki* pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 *ki* point in his
pool. He cannot exceed his *ki* pool's maximum. At 11th level, each time
the monk successfully steals *ki*, he can make an immediate saving throw
against one disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for
failing this saving throw. The monk gains a bonus equal to his Wisdom
modifier on the saving throw. This ability replaces purity of body.

**Life Funnel (Su)**: At 7th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal a
creature's life force to replenish his own. If the monk has at least 1
*ki* point in his *ki* pool and scores a confirmed critical hit against
a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he
heals a number of hit points equal to his monk level. As with steal
*ki*, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory act, no better
than what the undead do to the living. A monk with this ability cannot
steal both *ki*and hit points at the same time. This ability replaces
wholeness of body.

**Life from a Stone (Su)**: At 11th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal
*ki* or life force from any creature, not just living creatures. If the
monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool, he gains the benefit of life
funnel and steal *ki* when he confirms a critical hit against any
creature or reduces any creature to 0 or fewer hit points. This ability
replaces diamond body.

**Sipping Demon (Su)**: A 13th level, a hungry ghost monk gains 1
temporary hit point each time he hits an enemy with a melee attack. The
monk gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his Wisdom modifier
when he scores a critical hit. The maximum number of temporary hit
points the monk can have is equal to his monk level. The temporary hit
points disappear 1 hour later. The monk can only use this ability when
he has at least 1 *ki* point in his *ki* pool. This ability is a
proscribed manipulation of *ki* considered by many good monks to be a
corruption. The ability replaces diamond soul.

### Ki Mystic

The *ki*mystic believes that violence is sometimes necessary, but
knowing and understanding is the true root of perfection. Through
meditation and spiritual visions, a *ki*mystic can see beyond the veil
of reality to the underlying truth of all existence. A *ki*mystic has
the following class features.

***Ki* Mystic (Su)**: At 3rd level, a *ki*mystic gains a pool of *ki*
points equal to his Wisdom modifier. The pool increases to 1/2 his monk
level + his Wisdom modifier + 2 at level 4. If the monk has at least 1
point of *ki* in his *ki* pool, he gains a +2 bonus on all
[Knowledge] skill checks. As a
swift action, the monk can spend 1 *ki* point immediately before making
an ability, or skill check to gain a +4 insight bonus on the check. This
ability replaces still mind.

**Mystic Insight (Su)**: At 5th level, a *ki*mystic becomes apt at
giving just the right word of advice in just the nick of time. As an
immediate action, the monk can spend 2 *ki* points to grant an ally
within 30 feet the ability to reroll a single attack roll or saving
throw. The ally must be able to hear the monk to gain the reroll
benefit. This ability replaces purity of body.

**Mystic Visions (Su)**: At 11th level, a *ki*mystic may receive mystic
visions when he rests. These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany,
or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in the monk's mind. The
effect is similar to a
*[Divination]*spell with a
caster level equal to the monk's level. The
*[Divination]* has no casting
time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every
night. Using this ability costs 2 *ki* points that are removed from the
next day's total. This ability replaces diamond body.

**Mystic Prescience (Su)**: At 13th level, a *ki*mystic gains a +2
insight bonus to AC and CMD. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +4.
This ability replaces diamond soul.

**Mystic Persistence (Su)**: At 19th level, a *ki*mystic can create an
aura once per day as a swift action at the cost of at least 2 points of
*ki.* The aura emanates out to a 20-foot radius. The monk and all allies
within the aura can roll two dice when making an attack roll or a saving
throw and take the better result. The aura lasts for 1 round, plus an
additional round for every 2 *ki* points spent when the monk created the
aura. The monk can dismiss the aura at any time as a free action, but
the *ki* points for the full duration of the aura are lost. This ability
replaces empty body.

### Monk of the Empty Hand

The monk of the empty hand eschews normal weapons in favor of whatever
is lying around—rocks, chair legs, flagons of ale, even a simple quill
pen all become deadly weapons in the hands of such a monk. A monk of the
empty hand draws on his own *ki* to infuse his improvised weapons with
power, and can transform a broken bottle into a magical weapon.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Monks of the empty hand are proficient
with the shuriken only. A monk of the empty hand treats normal weapons
as improvised weapons with the following equivalencies (substituting all
of their statistics for the listed weapon): a light weapon functions as
a light hammer, a one-handed weapon functions as a club, and a
two-handed weapon functions as a quarterstaff. This replaces the normal
monk weapon proficiencies.

**Flurry of Blows (Ex)**: Starting at 1st level, a monk of the empty
hand can make a flurry of blows using any combination of unarmed strikes
or attacks with an improvised weapon. He may not make a flurry of blows
with any other weapons, including special monk weapons. A monk of the
empty hand's flurry of blows otherwise functions as normal for a monk of
his level.

**Bonus Feat**: A monk of the empty hand adds the following feats to his
list of bonus feats at 6th level: [Improved Dirty Trick]\*),
[Improved Steal]\*), and
[Improvised Weapon Mastery].

**Versatile Improvisation (Ex)**: At 3rd level, as a swift action, a
monk of the empty hand may use an improvised weapon to deal damage as if
it were another type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) for 1 round,
regardless of the weapon's normal damage type. This ability replaces
still mind.

***Ki* Pool (Su)**: At 4th level, in addition to the normal abilities of
his *ki* pool, a monk of the empty hand may spend 1 point from his *ki*
pool to increase the range increment for an improvised thrown weapon or
shuriken by 20 feet for 1 round.

***Ki* Weapons (Su)**: At 5th level, a monk of the empty hand may spend
1 point from his *ki* pool as a swift action to deal damage equal to his
unarmed strike damage with an improvised weapon for 1 round. At 11th
level, the monk may spend *ki* to grant an enhancement bonus or magical
weapon abilities to an improvised weapon for 1 round, at the rate of 1
point of *ki* per +1 bonus or its equivalent. The monk may not spend
more than 3 points of *ki* at one time for this purpose. For example, a
monk can spend 2 points of *ki* to give his improvised weapon a +1
enhancement bonus and the *[Ki Focus]* quality, or
just the *[Flaming Burst]* quality.
At 15th level, the limit increases to 5 *ki* per round. The monk may use
this ability to add magical weapon qualities to improvised weapons that
could not normally have such a quality, such as adding the
*[Disruption]*
quality to a slashing weapon, or the
*[Vorpal]* quality to a
bludgeoning weapon. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond
body.

### Monk of the Four Winds

The monk of the four winds is connected to the natural world in a way
few other creatures—even other monks—can hope to match. He can call upon
the elements and the spirits of the world in times of need, and as he
nears his goal of perfection, he gains the ability to slow down time and
even defeat death itself. A monk of the four winds has the following
class features.

**[Elemental Fist])
(Su)**: At 1st level, a monk of the four winds gains [Elemental Fist]) as a bonus feat,
even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 5th level, and every five
levels thereafter, the monk increases the damage of his [Elemental Fist]) by 1d6 (2d6 at 5th
level, 3d6 at 10th level, and so on). This ability replaces [Stunning Fist].

**Slow Time (Su)**: At 12th level, a monk of the four winds can use his
*ki* to slow time or quicken his movements, depending on the observer.
As a swift action, the monk can expend 6 *ki* points to gain three
standard actions during his turn instead of just one. The monk can use
these actions to do the following: take a melee attack action, use a
skill, use an extraordinary ability, or take a move action. The monk
cannot use these actions to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, and
cannot combine them to take full-attack actions. Any move actions the
monk makes this turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability
replaces abundant step.

**Aspect Master (Su)**: At 17th level, a monk of the four winds must
choose an aspect of one of the great spirits of the world. Once made,
this choice cannot be changed. This spirit grants the monk a new
appearance and new abilities, as well as changing or augmenting the
monk's personality in some way. Once this choice is made, it cannot be
changed. The monk must abide by the alignment restrictions of the
aspect. If the monk ever changes his alignment to something outside the
aspect's alignment restrictions, he loses this ability and cannot regain
it unless his alignment later changes again to match that of the aspect.
This ability replaces timeless body.

*Aspect of the Carp*: The monk's skin becomes a coat of golden,
iridescent fish scales, his neck grows gills, and his fingers become
webbed. He can breathe water and gains a swim speed equal to his land
speed. The carp is heroic and adventurous—a monk must be nonevil to take
on the aspect of the carp.

*Aspect of the Ki-Rin*: The monk's skin takes on a golden luminescence,
and a silvery mane that cannot be bound grows atop his head. He gains a
fly speed equal to his land speed, but he must end each turn on the
ground. If the monk does not land by the end of his turn, he falls from
whatever height he has attained. The ki-rin is honorable, honest, and
self-sacrificing—a monk must be lawful good to take on the aspect of the
ki-rin.

*Aspect of the Monkey*: The monk's face becomes that of a monkey, and he
grows a prehensile tail. The monk can pick up objects and make unarmed
attacks with his tail (though the tail does not grant additional unarmed
attacks or natural attacks). In addition, the monk gains a climb speed
equal to his land speed. The monkey is a creature of whimsy and a lover
of pranks—a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the monkey.

*Aspect of the Oni*: The monk's skin becomes pitch black, and his hair
turns white, black, red, or violet. He can assume *[Gaseous Form]* (as the spell) as a
standard action for 1 minute per day per monk level. This duration does
not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.
The oni is treacherous and deceitful, and it hungers for the pain and
death of living creatures—a monk must be evil to take on the aspect of
the oni.

*Aspect of the Owl*: The monk grows feathers, and his head becomes
avian, with wide, unblinking eyes. He gains a fly speed of 30 feet. The
owl is a sage creature, deeply serious, and driven toward a single
goal—a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the owl.

*Aspect of the Tiger*: Dark stripes appear on the monk's skin, and his
face becomes more feline. His eyes become catlike, with vertical pupils,
and his canines enlarge. Once per hour, the monk can move at 10 times
his normal land speed when he makes a charge and is treated as if he had
the pounce ability. The tiger is swift, fierce, and deadly—a monk of any
alignment can take on the aspect of the tiger.

**Immortality (Su)**: At 20th level, a monk of the four winds no longer
ages. He remains in his current age category forever. Even if the monk
comes to a violent end, he spontaneously *reincarnates*(as the spell) 24
hours later in a place of his choosing within 20 miles of the place he
died. The monk must have visited the place in which he returns back to
life at least once. This ability replaces perfect self.

### Monk of the Healing Hand

Monks of the healing hand seek perfection through helping others. By
focusing their meditations on the flow of life within themselves and all
creation they gain an understanding of how to share their *ki* with
others, healing wounds and even bringing the dead back to life. For such
a monk, sacrificing himself to save another is the surest way to achieve
transcendence. A monk of the healing hand has the following class
features.

**Ancient Healing Hand (Su)**: At 7th level, a monk of the healing hand
can heal another creature's wounds with a touch. As a full-round action,
the monk can spend 2 *ki* points to heal a number of hit points equal to
the monk's level. He needs at least one hand free to use this ability,
and cannot heal himself. If the action is interrupted, the subject heals
no hit points, and the *ki* points are lost. This ability replaces
wholeness of body.

***Ki* Sacrifice (Su)**: At 11th level, a monk of the healing hand can
use his entire *ki* pool to bring a person back to life. It takes 1 hour
to perform this ritual. At the end of the ritual, the monk sacrifices
all of his*ki*in order to cast *[Raise Dead]* (as the spell) with a
caster level equal to his monk level. The ritual uses all of the *ki* in
the monk's *ki* pool; the monk must have at least 6 points of *ki* in
his *ki* pool to use this ability. At 15th level, the monk may sacrifice
his *ki* to cast
*[Resurrection]*. The monk
must have at least 8 points of *ki* in his *ki* pool to use this
ability. These rituals do not require material components. When this
ability is used, the monk's *ki* pool is not replenished until 24 hours
have passed. This ability replaces both diamond body and quivering palm.

**True Sacrifice (Su)**: At 20th level, in a final selfless act, a monk
of the healing hand can draw in his entire *ki*, which then explodes
outward in a 50-foot-radius emanation. All dead allies within the
emanation are brought back to life, as if they were the subject of a
*[True Resurrection]*
spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. When the monk does
this, he is truly and utterly destroyed. A monk destroyed in this way
can never come back to life, not even by way of a
*[Wish]* or
*[Miracle]* spell or by the power of
a deity. Furthermore, the monk's name can never be spoken or written
down again. All written mentions of his name become nothing more than a
blank space. This ability replaces perfect self.

### Monk of the Lotus

Monks are warriors who hone their bodies into deadly weapons, but some
monks eschew violence in favor of a more peaceful philosophy. While a
monk of the lotus realizes that combat cannot always be avoided—and is
more than capable in a fight—he understands that all creatures are
connected, and to harm another is to harm the self. Instead, he strives
to find peaceful resolutions to conflicts, and in doing so, hopes to
achieve inner peace. A monk of the lotus has the following class
features.

**[Touch of Serenity])
(Su)**: At 1st level, a monk of the lotus gains [Touch of Serenity]) as a bonus
feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, and
every six levels thereafter, the duration of [Touch of Serenity]) increases
by 1 round. Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new Will
save to end the effect. This duration does not stack; only the longest
remaining duration applies. This ability replaces [Stunning Fist].

**Touch of Surrender (Su)**: At 12th level, a monk of the lotus makes a
foe into a friend with a single show of mercy. As an immediate action,
when one of his melee attacks would reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit
points, the monk can spend 6 *ki* points to make the target of that
attack surrender. When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit
points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast
*[Charm Monster]* with a
caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving
throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires,
until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the
target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens
first. The monk can only have one creature charmed with touch of
surrender at a time. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. This ability
replaces abundant step.

**Touch of Peace (Su)**: At 15th level, a monk of the lotus can set up
vibrations within the body of another creature to win over the
creature's mind. The monk can use touch of peace once per day, and must
announce his intent before making his attack roll. On a successful hit,
the attack deals no damage, but the target is charmed as if the monk had
cast *[Charm Monster]*
with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a
saving throw against this effect. The creature is charmed for 1 day per
level. If the monk or his allies attack the charmed creature, or if the
monk asks or commands the charmed creature to take hostile actions, the
effect ends. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. This ability
replaces quivering palm.

**Learned Master (Ex)**: At 17th level, a monk of the lotus gains all
[Knowledge] skills and the
[Linguistics] skill as class
skills. The monk uses Wisdom instead of Intelligence as the key ability
for these skills. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and the moon.

### Monk of the Sacred Mountain

The monk of the sacred mountain finds strength and power in the earth
beneath his feet. Rather than spinning though the battlefield with the
fluid motion of the river, he roots himself to the ground, as immovable
and unshakable as the stones of the mountain. A monk of the sacred
mountain has the following class features.

**Iron Monk (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a monk of the sacred mountain gains
[Toughness] as a bonus feat. In addition,
the monk gains a +1 natural armor bonus. This ability replaces evasion.

**Bastion Stance (Ex)**: At 4th level, a monk of the sacred mountain
becomes like stone, nearly impossible to move when he stands his ground.
If the monk starts and ends his turn in the same space, he cannot be
knocked prone or forcibly moved until the start of his next turn, except
by mind-affecting or teleportation effects. At 16th level, he is immune
to any attempts to force him to move, even mind-affecting and
teleportation effects. This ability replaces slow fall.

**Iron Limb Defense (Ex)**: At 5th level, a monk of the sacred mountain
can deflect blows with an active defense that complements his bastion
stance. If the monk starts and ends his turn in the same space, he gains
a +2 shield bonus to AC and CMD until the start of his next turn. As a
swift action, he can spend 1 *ki* point to increase this bonus to +4.
This ability replaces high jump.

**Adamantine Monk (Ex)**: At 9th level, a monk of the sacred mountain
has muscles so strong and skin so resilient that he gains DR 1/—. This
DR increases by 1 for every three levels thereafter. As a swift action,
the monk can spend 1 *ki* point to double his DR until the beginning of
his next turn. This ability replaces improved evasion.

**Vow of Silence (Su)**: At 17th level, a monk of the sacred mountain
becomes as impassive as stone, making a vow of silence in exchange for
greater abilities. The monk gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD and a
+4 bonus on [Sense Motive],
[Stealth], and
[Perception] checks. The monk
does not lose the capacity for speech, but if he ever speaks, he loses
this feature for 24 hours. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and
the moon.

### Weapon Adept

While all monks train in both unarmed combat and with weapons, the
weapon adept seeks to become one with his weapons, transforming them
into perfect extensions of his own body. Through such training, a weapon
adept seeks to attain perfection by becoming a living weapon himself. A
weapon adept has the following class features.

**[Perfect Strike])
(Ex)**: At 1st level, a weapon adept gains [Perfect Strike]) as a bonus feat,
even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 10th level, the monk can
roll his attack roll three times and take the higher result. If one of
these rolls is a critical threat, he can choose which one of his other
two rolls to use as his confirmation roll. This ability replaces
[Stunning Fist].

**Way of the Weapon Master (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a weapon adept gains
[Weapon Focus] as a bonus feat with one
of his monk weapons. At 6th level, the monk gains [Weapon Specialization] with the same
weapon as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This
ability replaces evasion.

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 9th level, the monk gains evasion. This ability
replaces improved evasion.

**Uncanny Initiative (Ex)**: At 17th level, a weapon adept does not need
to roll for initiative. He always treats his initiative roll as if it
resulted in any number of his choosing (from 1 to 20). This ability
replaces timeless body.

**Pure Power**: At 20th level, a weapon adept forsakes the ideals of the
perfect self to become a bastion of the physical and mental virtues
monks hold dear. The monk gains a +2 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and
Wisdom. This ability replaces perfect self.

### Zen Archer

Some monks seek to become one with another weapon entirely—the bow. The
zen archer takes a weapon most other monks eschew and seeks perfection
in the pull of a taut bowstring, the flex of a bow's limbs, and the
flight of an arrow fired true.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Zen archers are proficient with
longbows, shortbows, composite longbows, and composite shortbows in
addition to their normal weapon proficiencies.

**Flurry of Blows (Ex)**: Starting at 1st level, a zen archer can make a
flurry of blows as a full-attack action, but only when using a bow (even
though it is a ranged weapon). He may not make a flurry of blows with
his unarmed attacks or any other weapons. A zen archer does not apply
his Strength bonus on damage rolls made with flurry of blows unless he
is using a composite bow with a Strength rating. A zen archer's flurry
of blows otherwise functions as normal for a monk of his level.

A zen archer cannot use [Rapid Shot] or
[Manyshot] when making a flurry of blows
with his bow.

**Bonus Feats**: A zen archer's bonus feats must be taken from the
following list: [Combat Reflexes],
[Deflect Arrows],
[Dodge], [Far Shot], [Point-Blank Shot], [Precise Shot], and [Rapid Shot]. At 6th level, the following feats
are added to the list: [Focused Shot]\*), [Improved Precise Shot],
[Manyshot],
[Mobility], and [Parting Shot]\*). At 10th level,
the following feats are added to the list: [Improved Critical], Pinpoint Targeting,
[Shot on the Run], and [Snatch Arrows]. A monk need not have any of
the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.
These feats replace the monk's normal bonus feats.

**[Perfect Strike])
(Ex)**: At 1st level, a zen archer gains [Perfect Strike]) as a bonus feat,
even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A zen archer can use
[Perfect Strike]) with
any bow. At 10th level, the monk can roll his attack roll three times
and take the highest result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat,
the monk must choose one of his other two rolls to use as his
confirmation roll. This ability replaces [Stunning Fist].

**Way of the Bow (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a zen archer gains [Weapon Focus] as a bonus feat with one type of
bow. At 6th level, the monk gains [Weapon Specialization] with the same
weapon as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This
ability replaces evasion.

**Zen Archery (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a zen archer may use his Wisdom
modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier on ranged attack rolls when
using a bow. This ability replaces maneuver training.

**[Point Blank Master]) (Ex)**: At
3rd level, a zen archer gains [Point Blank Master]\*) as a bonus
feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces
still mind.

***Ki* Pool (Su)**: At 4th level, in addition to the normal abilities of
his *ki* pool, a zen archer may spend 1 point from his *ki* pool to
increase the range increment for his bow by 50 feet for 1 round.

***Ki* Arrows (Su)**: At 5th level, a zen archer may spend 1 point from
his *ki* pool as a swift action to change the damage dice of arrows he
shoots to that of his unarmed strikes. This lasts until the start of his
next turn. For example, a Medium zen archer's short bow normally deals
1d6 damage; using this ability, his arrows deal 1d8 damage until the
start of his next turn. This ability replaces purity of body.

**Reflexive Shot (Ex)**: At 9th level, a zen archer can make attacks of
opportunity with arrows from his bow. The monk still threatens squares
he could reach with unarmed strikes, and can still only make one attack
of opportunity per round (unless he has [Combat Reflexes]). This ability replaces
improved evasion.

**Trick Shot (Su)**: At 11th level, a zen archer may hit targets that he
might otherwise miss. By spending 1 point from his *ki* pool as a swift
action, the zen archer can ignore concealment. By spending 2 points, he
can ignore total concealment or cover. By spending 3 points, he can
ignore total cover, even firing arrows around corners. The arrow must
still be able to reach the target; a target inside a closed building
with no open doors or windows cannot be attacked. These effects last for
1 round. This ability replaces diamond body.

***Ki Focus* Bow (Su)**: At 17th level, as long as he has at least 1
point of *ki* in his *ki* pool, a zen archer may treat arrows fired from
his bow as if they were *[ki focus]* weapons,
allowing him to use his special *ki* attacks as if his arrows were
unarmed attacks. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.


## Paladin

Holy warriors and defenders of the faith, paladins know that the only
thing more abhorrent than an evil creature is a fundamentally good
creature too timid to strive against the forces of darkness. Paladins
are divine champions, gladly giving their lives in the service of light
and justice, asking only that they may protect the innocent and cleanse
the world to the best of their ability. Theirs is a hard path, requiring
great sacrifice and ultimate devotion to a moral code, yet with her last
breath a paladin can take comfort in a life of absolute righteousness.

Presented below are several variant class features to help flesh out
common paladin archetypes, the better to customize characters for
fighting the good fight.

### Divine Defender

Some paladins see themselves as the last line of defense between the
teeming hordes of evil and the innocent folk trying to make a living in
a harsh, unforgiving world. These defenders spend their lives protecting
others and taking on foes that the common man should not even know
exist. To aid them in their holy mission, they have special powers to
protect themselves and those around them. The divine defender has the
following class features.

**Shared Defense (Su)**: At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one
use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all
adjacent allies (including paladins) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent
allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and CMD and on their saving
throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the divine
defender's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus
increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies
within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within
this area are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are
granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are
immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all
allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25% chance to
negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This
ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium,
or heavy
*[Fortification]*
armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other.
Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This
ability replaces mercy.

**Divine Bond (Su)**: At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond
with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her
armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by
calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute
per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed
light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1
enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains
another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These
bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses
to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following
armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter
7): *[Champion]*\*, *[Ghost Touch], Heavy
[Fortification],
[Invulnerability],
[Light]
[Fortification],
Moderate
[Fortification],
[Spell Resistance]*(13,
15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus
equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 of the *Core Rulebook*). In
addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of
the following armor properties: *[Energy Resistance]*for +3
bonus, *improved [Energy Resistance]* for
+5 bonus, or *[Righteous]*\* for +4
bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has,
but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at
least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties
can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are
determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the
spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the
armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes
giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine
defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one
additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of
four times per day at 17th level.

If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine
defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a
level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine
defender takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

### Hospitaler

Paladins are known for their charity and for tending to the sick. The
hospitaler takes to this calling above all others, spending much of her
time healing the poor, and giving aid and succor to those in need. The
hospitaler has the following class features.

**Smite Evil (Su)**: This functions as the paladin ability, but the
hospitaler can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level, and
every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three levels
thereafter).

**Channel Positive Energy (Su)**: When a hospitaler reaches 4th level,
she gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric equal to
her paladin level -3. She can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using this ability does not expend
uses of lay on hands, as it does with other paladins. This replaces the
standard paladin's channel positive energy ability.

**Aura of Healing (Su)**: At 11th level, a hospitaler can expend one use
of her channel positive energy ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing
for a number of rounds equal to her paladin level. Allies in this aura
(including the hospitaler) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points
and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the
paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an
amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a
saving throw against any afflictions they are suffering from, such as a
curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing
the affliction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies
can only be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only
attempt additional saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed
to this aura multiple times. This ability replaces aura of justice.

### Sacred Servant

Paladins as a general rule, venerate the gods of good and purity, but
some take this a step further, dedicating themselves to a specific deity
and furthering the cause of the faith. These sacred servants are
rewarded for their devotion with additional spells and powerful allies.
A sacred servant must select one deity to worship. This deity's
alignment must be lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good. A sacred
servant has the following class features.

**Smite Evil (Su)**: This functions as the paladin ability, but the
sacred servant can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level,
and every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three
levels thereafter). This replaces smite evil.

**Spells**: At 4th level, when a sacred servant gains the ability to
cast spells, she also chooses one domain associated with her deity. Her
effective cleric level for this domain is equal to her paladin level -3.
In addition, she also gains one domain spell slot for each level of
paladin spells she can cast. Every day she must prepare the domain spell
from her chosen domain in that spell slot.

**Divine Bond (Su)**: At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond
with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy
symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial
spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called,
the spirit causes the sacred servant's holy symbol to shed light like a
torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels
beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be
spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to
channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to
grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin
spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy
when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/day of
lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple
times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the
spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again.
If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per
day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once
used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is
called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if
the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but
resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred
servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one
additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of
four times per day at 17th level.

If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred
servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a
level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the sacred
servant takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

**Call Celestial Ally (Sp)**: At 8th level, a sacred servant can call
upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant. This allows
the sacred servant to cast *[Lesser Planar Ally]* once per week
as a spell-like ability without having to pay the material component
cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level, this improves
to *[Planar Ally]* and at
16th level, this improves to *[Greater Planar Ally]*. The sacred
servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level.
This ability replaces aura of resolve.

### Shining Knight

While paladins often are seen mounted atop a loyal steed, the shining
knight is the true symbol of mounted bravery. They are never far from
their steeds and are always clad in brightly polished armor. The shining
knight has the following class features.

**Skilled Rider (Ex and Su)**: At 3rd level, a shining knight does not
take any penalty to her [Ride] skill due
to her armor check penalty. In addition, any mount she is riding gains
the benefit of her divine grace class feature, adding her Charisma bonus
(if any) to its saving throws. This ability replaces divine health.

**Divine Bond (Su)**: Upon reaching 5th level, a shining knight must
form a bond with a mount. This ability otherwise functions as the
paladin ability.

**Knight's Charge (Su)**: At 11th level, whenever a mounted shining
knight charges a foe, her movement does not provoke attacks of
opportunity, for either her or her mount. In addition, if her target is
also the target of her smite evil ability and the charge attack hits,
the target must make a Will save or be panicked for a number of rounds
equal to 1/2 the shining knight's level. The DC of this save is equal to
10 + 1/2 the shining knight's level + the shining knight's Charisma
modifier. This ability replaces aura of justice.

### Undead Scourge

Undead are an abomination in the eyes of the just and righteous. It is
no surprise then that there are some paladins that dedicate themselves
to wiping these unholy terrors from the world. The following are the
class features of the undead scourge.

**Smite Evil (Su)**: This functions as the paladin ability of the same
name, but the undead scourge does not deal 2 points of damage per level
on the first successful attack against evil dragons and evil outsiders.
She does deal 2 points of damage per level on all smite attacks made
against evil undead creatures.

**Aura of Life (Su)**: At 8th level, an undead scourge emits a 10-foot
aura of life around her that weakens undead creatures. Undead in this
aura take a -4 penalty on Will saves made to resist positive energy. In
addition, undead in this aura do not regain hit points from channeled
negative energy. This ability replaces aura of resolve.

**Undead Annihilation (Su)**: At 11th level, an undead scourge can
expend one use of her smite evil ability as a standard action and make a
single melee attack against an undead creature. If this attack hits, the
undead creature must make a Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is
equal to 10 + 1/2 the undead scourge's level + the undead scourge's
Charisma modifier. Undead with twice as many Hit Dice as the undead
scourge are unaffected by this ability. If the attack misses, the smite
evil is wasted without effect. This ability replaces aura of justice.

### Warrior of the Holy Light

Some paladins use their gifts to focus on the holy light that shines
within their souls. With the gifts of purity and redemption, these
paladins spend much of their lives helping others find the true path.
Unleashing this power takes patience and comes at a steep price.
Warriors of the holy light have the following class features.

**Power of Faith (Su)**: At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light
learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her
allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature.
A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting
abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or
spell completion magic items.

At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of
her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on
hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can
spend a use of her lay on hands ability to call upon the power of her
faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of
*[Light]* to emanate from the warrior of
the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including
the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on
attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as
they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute.

At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies,
curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell
*[Lesser Restoration]*. A
creature can only be healed in this way once per day.

At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as
*[Daylight]* for the purposes of
affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus
grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area
resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy
light when this power is activated.

At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light
and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25% chance that
critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies
in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with
other abilities that grant similar protection (such as
*[Light]
[Fortification]*).

At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of
60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to
AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear
increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4.
The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally,
protection against critical hits increases to 50%.

**Shining Light (Su)**: At 14th level, a warrior of the holy light can
unleash a 30-foot burst of pure, white light as a standard action. Evil
creatures within this burst take 1d6 points of damage for every two
paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil
outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.
A Reflex save halves this damage and negates the blindness. The DC of
this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level +
the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. Good creatures within
this burst are healed 1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and
receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving
throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can
use this ability once per day at 14th level plus one additional time per
day at 17th and 20th levels. This ability replaces aura of faith.

#### Antipaladin (Alternate Class)


*Not all paladins that fall become antipaladins. In fact, the transformation is quite rare. Most paladins spend months or even years regaining their paladinhood, but they never stray so far from the path as to become irredeemable. Rarely, a paladin turns from the light and seeks instead to make a pact with the dark powers. Often this is through temptation or some sort of ruse, but once the deal is struck, the paladin finds himself on the path to damnation.*

*When such a fall occurs, the transformation can be swift. The paladin trades in all of his paladin levels for antipaladin levels on a 1-for-1 basis. This is usually a traumatic experience, involving a complex ritual that involves a living sacrifice and dark oaths made to foul powers (who sometimes send minions to bear witness). Once complete, the anitpaladin emerges, ready to bring ruin to the world.*

*It should be noted that not all antipaladins are fallen heroes. Some warriors are trained from a young age to assume the mantle of antipaladin, forged through pain and trauma into exemplars of evil. These cruel warriors know nothing of compassion or loyalty, but they can teach a great deal about pain and suffering.*

Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the
path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out
redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers
through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the
dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark
powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their
former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the
farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their
pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.

Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make
pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead
of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead
armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to
the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at
nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.

The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering
numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't
truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the
changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class
are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely
different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new
class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just
as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this
chapter.

**Role**: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care
nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and
destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they
do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.

As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses [Table: Antipaladin] to determine its base attack
bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along
with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.

**Alignment**: Chaotic evil.

**Hit Die**: d10.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the antipaladin.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Antipaladins are proficient with all
simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and
light), and with shields (except tower shields).

**Aura of Evil (Ex)**: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see
the *[detect evil]*spell) is
equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an
antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first
successful attack.

**Detect Good (Sp)**: At will, an antipaladin can use *[detect good],*as the spell. An
antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or
individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the
strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While
focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect
good in any other object or individual within range.

**Smite Good (Su)**: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the
dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the
antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is
good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack
rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against
the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with
the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels
of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack
increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses.
Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR
the creature might possess.

In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a
deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC
against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin
targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.

The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or
the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this
ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the
antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on
Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.

**Unholy Resilience (Su)**: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus
equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.

**Touch of Corruption (Su)**: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin
surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to
open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of
times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a
touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every
two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard
action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead
creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin
possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that
specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For
example, the [Extra Lay On Hands]
feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption
class feature.

**Aura of Cowardice (Su)**: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a
palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a
-4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are
normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an
antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the
antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.

**Plague Bringer (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an
antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not
take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract
diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their
effects.

**Cruelty (Su)**: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an
antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the
antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses
touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also
receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by
the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target
receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is
successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects
of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level,
the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.

*• Fatigued*: The target is fatigued.

*• Shaken*: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the
antipaladin.

*• Sickened*: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the
antipaladin.

At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of
those that can be selected.

*• Dazed*: The target is dazed for 1 round.

*• Diseased*: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had
cast *[contagion]*, using his
antipaladin level as his caster level.

*• Staggered*: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the
antipaladin.

At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of
those that can be selected.

*• Cursed*: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast
*[bestow curse]*, using his
antipaladin level as his caster level.

*• Exhausted*: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the
fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.

*• Frightened*: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of
the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before
selecting this cruelty.

*• Nauseated*: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of
the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before
selecting this cruelty.

*• Poisoned*: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast
*[poison]*, using the antipaladin's
level as the caster level.

At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list
of those that can be selected.

*• Blinded*: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the
antipaladin.

*• Deafened*: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the
antipaladin.

*• Paralyzed*: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.

*• Stunned*: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the
antipaladin.

These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level
antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and
might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or
diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.

**Channel Negative Energy (Su)**: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level,
he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a
cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption
ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level
when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.

**Spells**: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to
cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the
antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must
choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an
antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell
level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's
spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier.
Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is
the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition,
he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see
Table 1-3 in the *Core Rulebook*). When Table 2-13 indicates that the
antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only
the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for
that spell level.

An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation
to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and
cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast
spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during
his daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and
higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.

**Fiendish Boon (Sp)**: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives
a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once
the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.

The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a
standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1
minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon
to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the
weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the
weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th
level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing
weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the
following weapon properties:
*[Anarchic]*,
*[Flaming], [Flaming Burst],
[Keen],
[Speed],
[Unholy],
[Vicious],
[Vorpal]*,
and *[Wounding]*. Adding these
properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see
Table 15-9 in the *Core Rulebook*). These bonuses are added to any
properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack.
If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be
added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties
granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and
cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit
imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the
antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin.
These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin
can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time
per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per
day at 17th level.

If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin
loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level,
whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes
a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a
fiendish servant. This functions as *[Summon Monster III]*, except the
duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a
single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil
subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is
set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon
reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the
*summon monster* spell increases by one, to a maximum of *[Summon
Monster IX]* at 17th level.

Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call
his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a
level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant
immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use
this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day
for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at
17th level.

At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the
*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant
gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.

Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the
antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains
an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period,
the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

**Aura of Despair (Su)**: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an
antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does
not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.

This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if
he is unconscious or dead.

**Aura of Vengeance (Su)**: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two
uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all
allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite
good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses
last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures
gain no benefit from this ability.

**Aura of Sin (Su)**: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are
treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as
evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This
ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is
unconscious or dead.

**Aura of Depravity (Su)**: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR
5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws
against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the
antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.

**Unholy Champion (Su)**: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a
conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good.
Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider,
the outsider is also subject to a
*[Banishment],*using his
antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol
automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the
*[Banishment]*effect and the
damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In
addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of
corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.

**Code of Conduct**: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment
and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and
altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin
cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such
actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's
code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all
else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and
punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his
goals.

**Associates**: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an
antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who
consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances,
an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them
from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need
an *[Atonement] *spell during
such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the
end—evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only
henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.

### Ex-Antipaladins

A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an
good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin
spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon,
armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in
levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement
potential if he atones for his violations (see the
*[Atonement]* spell), as
appropriate.


## Ranger

Where the average druid eschews settlements entirely, seeking solace in
the wilds, rangers are the border riders, living on civilization's
tattered edge. They are the scouts and the bounty hunters, the trackers
and woodsmen, and in their chosen environments they are unmatchable.
Self-sufficient and keenly aware of their surroundings, rangers surive
through strength, wit, and adaptability, stalking their prey and melting
into the woods or wastes without a trace. It is this very adapabtibility
and staunch, pioneering sense of independence that leads rangers out of
more formal society or schooling and into a number of different
specializations and combat styles, from two-handed fighting and
breathtaking feats of archery to mastery of particular terrains or
communication with the beasts around them.

Presented below are a number of alternate class features and archetypes
to help customize your ranger, whether he's a bold master of beasts or a
shifty forest scout adept at tracking the enemy and picking off the
unwary.

### New Combat Styles

At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of the two core [Combat Styles] or one of the
following new combat styles: crossbow, mounted combat, natural weapon,
two-handed weapon, or weapon and shield style. The ranger can choose
feats from his selected combat style even if he does not have the normal
prerequisites.

**Crossbow**: If the ranger selects crossbow style, he can choose from
the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: [Deadly Aim], [Focused Shot]), [Precise Shot], and [Rapid Reload]. At 6th level, he adds [Crossbow Mastery]) and [Improved
Precise Shot] to the list. At
10th level, he adds[Pinpoint Targeting] and [Shot on the Run] to the list.

**[Mounted Combat]**: If the ranger
selects mounted combat, he can choose from the following list whenever
he gains a combat style feat: [Mounted Combat], [Mounted Archery], [Ride-By Attack], and [Trick Riding]). At 6th level, he
adds [Mounted Shield])
and [Spirited Charge] to the list. At
10th level, he adds [Mounted Skirmisher]) and
[Unseat] to the list.

**Natural Weapon**: If the ranger selects natural weapon style, he can
choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat:
[Aspect of the Beast],
[Improved Natural Weapon],
[Rending Claws]), and
[Weapon Focus]. At 6th level, he adds
Eldritch Fangs and [Vital Strike] to the
list. At 10th level, he adds [Multiattack and][Improved Vital Strike] to the list.

**Two-Handed Weapon**: If the ranger selects two-handed weapon style, he
can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style
feat: [Cleave], [Power Attack], [Pushing Assault]), and [Shield
of Swings]). At 6th
level, he adds [Furious Focus]) and [Great Cleave] to the list. At 10th level, he
adds [Dreadful Carnage]) and [Improved Sunder] to the list.

**Weapon and Shield**: If the ranger selects weapon and shield style, he
can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style
feat: [Improved Shield Bash],
[Shield Focus], [Shield Slam], and [Two-Weapon Fighting]. At 6th level, he adds
[Saving Shield]) and
[Shield Master] to the list. At 10th
level, he adds [Bashing Finish]) and [Greater
Shield Focus] to the list.

### Beast Master

Some rangers, particularly those in primitive lands or who were raised
by animals, have unusually strong bonds with animals. Unique among
rangers, they can bond with multiple animals of any kind, creating a
menagerie of wild yet loyal creatures, like a strange family. A beast
master has the following class features.

**Class Skills**: A beast master's class skills are
[Acrobatics] (Dex),
[Climb] (Str),
[Craft] (Int), [Escape Artist] (Dex), [Handle Animal] (Cha),
[Heal] (Wis),
[Intimidate] (Cha),
[Knowledge] (nature) (Int),
[Perception] (Wis),
[Ride] (Dex),
[Stealth] (Dex),
[Survival] (Wis), and
[Swim] (Wis). These replace the standard
ranger class skills.

**Animal Companion (Ex)**: A beast master forms a close bond with an
animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion
ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his
ranger level - 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and
[Handle Animal] checks
made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast
master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all
possibile animal companion choices—he may choose freely among all animal
companion choices, just as a druid can.

The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must
divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine
the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an
effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two
2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each
time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide
how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the
option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid
level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed
while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a
companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to
another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not
give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects
all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter's bond.

**Improved Empathic Link (Su)**: The beast master gains an empathic link
with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link
with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion's
eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes
(as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free
action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a
time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces
the 6th-level combat style feat.

**Strong Bond (Ex)**: At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond
with his animal companions. The ranger's effective druid level for his
animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he may immediately
allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees fit. This
ability replaces camouflage.

### Guide

Many rangers are loners, but some choose to use their familiarity with
the land to guide others safely through the wilderness. The guide
forgoes a favored enemy to focus on the task or foe at hand, and can
pass his knowledge and luck on to his charges. A guide has the following
class features.

**Ranger's Focus (Ex)**: At 1st level, once per day, the guide can focus
on a single enemy within line of sight as a swift action. That creature
remains the ranger's focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
or surrenders, or until the ranger designates a new focus, whichever
occurs first. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls
against the target of his focus. At 5th level, and every five levels
thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.

At 4th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the ranger can use this
ability one additional time per day. This ability replaces favored
enemy.

**Terrain Bond (Ex)**: At 4th level, the guide forms a bond with the
land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his
favored terrain, the ranger grants all allies within line of sight and
that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and
[Perception],
[Stealth], and
[Survival] skill checks. Also, as
long as they travel with him, the ranger's allies leave no trail and
can't be tracked. The ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail,
or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires.
This ability replaces hunter's bond.

**Ranger's Luck (Ex)**: Upon reaching 9th level, once per day the guide
can either reroll one of his attack rolls or force an enemy who just hit
him with an attack to reroll the attack roll. The ranger must take the
result of the second roll even if it is worse. A ranger can use this
ability once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day at
14th and 19th levels. This ability replaces evasion.

**Inspired Moment (Ex)**: At 11th level, the guide can have an inspired
moment once per day as a free action. The ranger gains the following
benefits until the end of his next turn. His speed increases by 10 feet.
He can take an extra move or swift action on his turn. He gains a +4
bonus to AC and on attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks.
Finally, he automatically confirms any critical threat he scores. He can
use this ability one additional time per day at 19th level. This ability
replaces quarry and improved quarry.

**Improved Ranger's Luck (Ex)**: Upon reaching 16th level, the ranger's
luck increases. He gains a +4 bonus on his rerolls made with the
ranger's luck ability, or if he forces an enemy to reroll an attack,
that enemy takes a -4 penalty on the roll. This bonus or penalty is also
applied on any roll to confirm critical hits. This ability replaces
improved evasion.

### Horse Lord

Rangers of the plains use horses or other riding beasts to hunt their
lands, forging a near-mystical relationship with their mounts. Horse
lords are unparalleled mounted combatants, the envy of even the most
dedicated cavalier. Though called “horse lords” as a generic term, these
rangers are not restricted to horses for their animal companions—any
creature the ranger can ride is included in these abilities. A horse
lord has the following class features.

**Combat Style Feat (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a horse lord must choose the
mounted combat style.

**Mounted Bond (Ex)**: At 4th level, the horse lord forms a bond with an
animal he can use as a mount, which becomes his animal companion. A
Medium ranger can select a camel or a horse. A small ranger can select a
pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or dog if he is at least 7th
level. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability
except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger
level - 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on [Handle Animal] and
[Ride] checks with his animal companion
mount. This ability replaces hunter's bond.

**Strong Bond (Ex)**: At 12th level, the horse lord strengthens his bond
with his mount. The ranger's effective druid level for his mount is now
equal to his ranger level. This ability replaces camouflage.

**Spiritual Bond (Su)**: At 17th level, the horse lord can grant his
animal companion temporary hit points equal to his ranger level once per
day. While these temporary hit points last, when his mount is within 30
feet of the him, he can choose to share the damage taken by his mount as
if using *[shield other]*.
This ability replaces hide in plain sight.

### Infiltrator

Some rangers study their favored enemies and learn their ways, applying
this knowledge to their own abilities and using their foes' strengths
against them. Infiltrators are willing to walk a mile in an enemy's
shoes so as to learn eveything there is to know about their foes in
order to more effectively hunt and kill them.

**Adaptation (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an infiltrator learns how to copy the
unusual abilities of his prey. He chooses one type of creature he has
selected as a favored enemy, such as “aberrations.” The ranger selects
one ability or feat from the adaptation list for that type (see below).
A ranger can use adaptations for 10 minutes per day per ranger level he
possesses. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be
used in 10-minute increments. If the adaptation requires the ranger to
make a more specific choice (such as what skill to use with [Skill Focus]), this choice is permanent and
cannot be changed.

At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his
favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type's list, as
well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type
he's selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired). The
infiltrator can only use one adaptation at a time. This class ability
replaces favored terrain.

*Aberration*: amphibious, darkvision 60 ft., [Iron Will], natural armor +2.

*Animal*: climb 15 ft., darkvision 60 ft., [Great Fortitude], [Lightning Reflexes], low-light vision,
natural armor (+2), swim 15 ft.

*Construct*: darkvision 60 ft., [Great Fortitude], [Lightning Reflexes], low-light vision.

*Dragon*: darkvision 60 ft., [Great Fortitude], [Iron Will], [Lightning Reflexes], low-light vision,
[Lunge].

*Fey*: [Iron Will], [Lightning Reflexes], low-light vision.

*Humanoid (aquatic)*: low-light vision, natural armor +2, darkvision,
swim 15 ft.

*Humanoid (dwarf)*: darkvision 60 ft., defensive training, greed,
hatred, hardy, slow and steady, stability, stonecunning, weapon
familiarity.

*Humanoid (elf)*: elf blood, low-light vision, elven immunities, elven
magic, keen senses, [Skill Focus] (choose
one skill), weapon familiarity.

*Humanoid (giant)*: low-light vision, [Lunge],
natural armor +2, resist energy 10 (choose cold, electricity, or fire),
[Throw Anything].

*Humanoid (gnoll)*: darkvision 60 ft., [Exotic Weapon Proficiency] (dire flail),
natural armor +2.

*Humanoid (gnome)*: defensive training, gnome magic, hatred, illusion
resistance, keen senses, low-light vision, obsessive, weapon
familiarity.

*Humanoid (goblinoid)*: darkvision 60 ft., goblin fast, [Skill Focus]
([Stealth]), natural armor (+2).

*Humanoid (halfling)*: fearless, halfling luck, keen senses,
sure-footed, weapon familiarity.

*Humanoid (human)*: [Great Fortitude], [Iron Will], [Lightning Reflexes], [Skill Focus] (choose one skill).

*Humanoid (orc)*: darkvision 60 ft., ferocity, intimidating, orc blood,
weapon familiarity.

*Humanoid (reptilian)*: darkvision 60 ft., kobold fast (as goblin fast),
lizardfolk hold breath, natural armor +2, [Skill Focus] (choose
[Acrobatics],
[Perception], or
[Stealth]).

*Magical Beast*: darkvision 60 ft., [Great Fortitude], low-light vision, natural
armor +2.

*Monstrous Humanoid*: darkvision 60 ft., [Lightning Reflexes], low-light vision,
natural armor +2.

*Ooze*: acid resistance 10, [Great Fortitude], [Iron Will], [Skill Focus] (choose
[Climb], [Escape Artist], or
[Perception]).

*Outsider*: darkvision 60 ft., energy resistance 5 (choose one type of
energy from acid, cold, electricity, or fire), [Great Fortitude], [Iron Will], [Lightning Reflexes].

*Plant*: low-light vision, [Great Fortitude], [Iron Will].

*Undead*: darkvision 60 ft., [Great Fortitude], [Iron Will], natural armor (+2). [Skill Focus]
([Stealth]).

*Vermin*: climb 15 ft., darkvision 60 ft., [Great Fortitude], [Iron Will], swim 15 ft.

### Shapeshifter

Most rangers venture into the wilderness, but there are some who let the
wilderness seep into them. Whether by curse, disease, ancient rite, a
slight lycanthropic influence in the blood, or the corrupting influence
of chaos, these rangers embrace the wild to transform themselves into
something untamed and feral. Shapeshifters are often held in awe, but
are even more often feared. A shapeshifter has the following class
features.

**Combat Style Feat (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a shapeshifter ranger must
choose the natural weapon combat style.

**Shifter's Blessing (Su)**: At 3rd level, the shapeshifter can take on
the aspects of a wild creature once per day as a swift action. He can
remain in this form for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level +
his Wisdom modifier. While in one of his shifter's blessing forms, the
ranger gains the shapeshifter subtype.

The shapeshifter must choose one of the following forms. Once this
choice is made, it cannot be changed.

*Form of the Bear*: The ranger's muscles enlarge and tighten, and his
facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains
a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but his base speed becomes 20 feet.

*Form of the Cat*: The ranger's muscles become lean and defined, and his
gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger
increases his base speed by 10 feet, and he gains a +4 bonus on
[Acrobatics] and
[Climb] checks.

*Form of the Dragon*: The ranger's skin becomes rough and scaly. While
in this form, the ranger gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.

*Form of the Eagle*: The ranger's skin stretches, his nose becomes
hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10
bonus on [Perception] checks.

*Form of the Jackal*: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his
movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger
can spend a move action to move up to 1/2 his speed without provoking
attacks of opportunity.

*Form of the Otter*: The ranger's hands and feet grow webs, and his body
grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the
ranger gains a swim speed of 30 feet and a +8 bonus on
[Swim] checks.

At 8th level and again every five levels thereafter, the ranger may
select an additional form for his shifter's blessing and may use this
ability one additional time per day. This is not a polymorph ability; a
ranger with shifter's blessing in one of his shifted forms can be
affected by a polymorph ability and retain his bonus and traits gained
by the class feature. This ability replaces favored terrain.

**Dual Form Shifter (Ex)**: At 12th level, when the shapeshifter takes
on a shifter's blessing form, he can take on a hybrid of two of his
forms. He gains the bonuses for both forms. This ability replaces
camouflage.

**Master Shifter (Su)**: At 20th level, the ranger's shifter's blessing
forms improve, and he can take on true forms of beasts. The ranger can
use dual form shifter with this ability, although he cannot use more
than one polymorph effect at any one time. This ability replaces master
hunter. The ranger's forms from shifter's blessing improve to the
following:

*Form of the Bear*: The ranger's muscles enlarge and tighten, and his
facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains
a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength and he does not suffer any reduction
of speed. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a
bear as if the caster of *[Beast Shape IV]*.

*Form of the Cat*: The ranger's muscles become lean and defined, and his
gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger
increases his base speed by 20 feet and he gains a +10 bonus on
[Acrobatics] and
[Climb] checks. Alternatively, the
ranger can polymorph into the form of a cat of any size as if the caster
of *[Beast Shape IV]*.

*Form of the Dragon*: The ranger's skin becomes rough and scaly. While
in this form, the ranger gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC and a fly
speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Alternately, the ranger
can polymorph into the form of a dragon as if the caster of *[Form of
the Dragon I]*.

*Form of the Eagle*: The ranger's skin stretches, his nose becomes
hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10
bonus on [Perception] checks
and a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability. Alternatively, the
ranger can polymorph into the form of an eagle or similar raptor as if
the caster of *[Beast Shape IV]*.

*Form of the Jackal*: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his
movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger
does not provoke attacks of opportunity due to movement. Alternatively,
the ranger can polymorph into the form of a jackal or other canine
creature as if the caster of *[Beast Shape IV]*.

*Form of the Otter*: The ranger's hands and feet grow webs, and his body
grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the
ranger gains a swim speed of 60 feet and a +5 bonus on
[Swim] checks. Alternatively, the ranger
can polymorph into the form of an otter or similar river mammal as if
the caster of *[Beast Shape IV]*.

### Skirmisher

Many rangers rely on spells, but there are some who eschew aid from
divine powers for their own reasons. Skirmishers rely on their wits,
their wisdom, and sometimes even instinct to aid in their quests. A
skirmisher has the following class features.

**Hunter's Tricks**: At 5th level, a skirmisher ranger learns the use of
hunter's tricks, which typically grant a boon or bonus to the ranger or
a nearby ally. At 5th level, the ranger learns one trick, selected from
the list below. At 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, he learns
another trick. A ranger can use these tricks a total number of times per
day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. Tricks are
usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a
standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it
can't be retrained. A ranger cannot select an individual trick more than
once. This ability replaces the ranger's spells class feature.
Skirmishers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have
a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic
items.

The following is a list of hunter tricks and their effects.

*Aiding Attack (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a free action
when he hits a creature with an attack. The next ally who makes an
attack against the target creature before the start of the ranger's next
turn gains a +2 circumstance bonus on that attack roll.

*Bolster Companion (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate
action when his animal companion is hit with an attack or a combat
maneuver. The companion's AC and combat maneuver defense increase by +4
for the purposes of that attack. If the attack still hits, the animal
companion only takes half damage (if any). The animal companion must be
able to see and hear the ranger to benefit from this trick.

*Catfall (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action
when he falls 20 or more feet, ignoring the first 20 feet of the fall
when calculating the falling damage. If the ranger takes no damage from
the fall, he does not fall prone.

*Chameleon Step (Ex)*: The ranger can move up to twice his speed as a
move action. The ranger does not take any penalty on
[Stealth] checks for movement during
this move. This move provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

*Cunning Pantomime (Ex)*: As a standard action, the ranger can
communicate with a single creature as if using the
*[tongues]* spell for 10 minutes.
Because the communication is slow and lacks subtlety, the ranger suffers
a -4 penalty on all [Bluff] and
[Diplomacy] checks relating to
the creature he is communicating with when using this trick.

*Defensive Bow Stance (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a swift
action. Until the start of his next turn, his ranged attacks do not
provoke attacks of opportunity.

*Deft Stand (Ex)*: The ranger can spend a move action to stand up
without provoking attacks of opportunity.

*Distracting Attack (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a free
action before he makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target takes a
-2 penalty on all attack rolls for 1 round.

*Hateful Attack (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a free action
when he makes an attack against one of his favored enemies. The ranger
doubles the threat range of his weapon for this attack. This does not
stack with other abilities that increase a weapon's threat range.

*Heel (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when
his animal companion moves. When the companion moves, the square it
starts out in is not considered threatened by any opponent it can see,
and therefore visible enemies do not get attacks of opportunity against
it when it moves from that square. The companion must end this movement
in a square adjacent to the ranger. The animal companion must be able to
see and hear the ranger to take this movement.

*Hobbling Attack (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a free action
when he hits with an attack. The target of the attack's land speed is
reduced by 1/2 for 1d4 rounds.

*Quick [Climb] (Ex)*: The ranger can
climb at his full speed as a move action without penalty.

*Quick Healing (Ex)*: As a swift action, the ranger can make a
[Heal] check to administer first aid on an
adjacent dying character. Alternatively, the ranger can administer a
potion to an unconscious character as a move action.

*Quick [Swim] (Ex)*: The ranger can swim
at his full speed as a move action without penalty.

*Ranger's Counsel (Ex)*: As a swift action, the ranger can grant all
allies within 30 feet that are within line of sight and can hear him a
+2 bonus on skill checks with a single skill of his choice. The ranger
must have at least one rank in the chosen skill. This bonus lasts for 1
round.

*Rattling Strike (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a free action
before he makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, the target is shaken
for 1d4 rounds.

*[Second Chance]) Strike
(Ex)*: When he misses with a melee attack, the ranger may reroll his
attack at a -5 penalty. Using this ability is an immediate action.

*Sic 'Em (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a swift action. His
animal companion makes one melee attack against an adjacent creature.
The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to make
this attack.

*Skill Sage (Ex)*: As a free action, the ranger can roll twice on any
one skill check and take the better result. He must have at least 1 rank
in that skill to use this ability.

*Stag's Leap (Ex)*: As a free action, the ranger can attempt a running
jump without moving 10 feet before the jump.

*Surprise Shift (Ex)*: The ranger can move 5 feet as a swift action.
This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count
as a 5-foot step.

*Tangling Attack (Ex)*: The ranger can use this attack as a free action
when he makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target is entangled for
1 round.

*Trick Shot (Ex)*: As a standard action, the ranger can make a ranged
attack that ignores concealment (but not total concealment), soft cover,
and partial cover.

*Uncanny Senses (Ex)*: As an immediate action, the ranger gains a +10
insight bonus on [Perception]
checks for 1 round.

*Upending Strike (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as a free action
just before he makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, he may make a
free trip combat maneuver against the target.

*Vengeance Strike (Ex)*: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate
action when an enemy adjacent to him hits an ally with a melee or ranged
attack. The ranger can make a single melee attack at his highest base
attack bonus against the creature who attacked his ally.

### Spirit Ranger

Some rangers nurture a connection with the spirits that reside in all
things. By communing with these spirits, the spirit ranger can gain
glimpses of things to come. A spirit ranger has the following class
features.

**Spirit Bond (Ex)**: At 4th level, instead of forming a bond with his
hunting companions or an animal companion, the spirit ranger forms a
bond with the spirits of nature themselves. Each day, as long as he is
within one of his favored terrains, the ranger can cast
*[Augury]* as a spell-like ability
with a caster level equal to his ranger level. In addition, he can call
upon these spirits to cast any one ranger spell that he is capable of
casting, without having to prepare the spell. At 8th level, and every
four levels thereafter, he can cast an additional spell in this way.
This replaces hunter's bond.

**Wisdom of the Spirits (Sp)**: At 12th level, the spirit ranger can use
his *[Augury]* spell-like ability even
when he is not in one of his favored terrains. If he is within one of
his favored terrains, the ranger can cast
*[Divination]* instead. Like
*[Augury]*, the caster level of the
*[Divination]* is equal to the
ranger's level. This ability replaces camouflage.

### Urban Ranger

For the urban ranger, the streets and sewers of the city are just as
dangerous as the barren wastelands or the deep forests. An urban ranger
has the following class features.

**Urban Ranger**: At 1st level, an urban ranger adds [Disable Device] and
[Knowledge] (local) to his list
of class skills and removes [Handle Animal] and
[Knowledge] (nature) from his
list of class skills.

**Favored Community (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the urban ranger forms a bond
with a community. While inside the limits of this community, he gains a
+2 bonus on initiative checks and
[Knowledge] (local),
[Perception],
[Stealth], and
[Survival] skill checks. An urban
ranger traveling through his favored community leaves no trail and
cannot be tracked (although he may leave a trail if he so desires).

At 8th level, and every five levels thereafter, an urban ranger may
select an additional favored community. In addition, at each such
interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored
community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by
+2.

For the purposes of this ability, a community is any settlement
consisting of 100 or more individuals. The community may be larger than
this minimum. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are not considered part
of a community. This ability replaces favored terrain.

**Trapfinding (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an urban ranger can find and disable
traps, as the rogue class feature of the same name. This ability
replaces endurance.

**Push Through (Ex)**: At 7th level, an urban ranger is never slowed by
difficult terrain in his favored communities. In addition, he can move
through the space occupied by local citizens as if they were allies.
This does not apply to creatures intent on harming the ranger. Areas
that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however,
still affect him. This replaces woodland stride.

**Blend In (Ex)**: An urban ranger of 12th level or higher can use his
[Stealth] bonus in place of a
[Disguise] skill check in any of
his favored communities. This disguise does not take an action to don.
He must make a check whenever someone attempts to pick him out from the
local citizens. If his check is successful, he blends into the crowd.
While not invisible, enemies do not notice his presence and take no
actions against him unless they are taking actions against the local
citizens in general. This replaces camouflage.

**Invisibility Trick (Sp)**: At 17th level, the urban ranger can cast
*[Greater Invisibility]* on himself as a wizard of his ranger level
as a swift action. He can use this spell-like ability a number of
times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This ability
replaces hide in plain sight.



## Rogue

By their nature, rogues are varied and versatile. There are rogues who
haunt the city, those who stalk the forest, and those who serve as
agents of law. Wherever there is space for someone to make her mark with
agility and wit, the rogue is there, using her wide range of skills and
abilities to make a place for herself, whether openly or through cunning
and subterfuge. And where a rogue's natural cunning and quick thinking
aren't enough to win the day, well—there's always the option of a knife
in the back.

The following rogue themes represent some of the most popular and
effective roguish archetypes. Each archetype comes with one or more
class features that must be taken. In addition, each archetype includes
a number of new rogue talent suggestions that, while not mandatory, help
to flesh out the character. Rogue talents and advanced rogue talents
marked with an asterisk (\*) in the archetype sections can be found in
the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*.

**Rogue Talents**: The following new rogue talents can be taken by any
rogue who meets the prerequisites. Note that rogue talents marked with a
double asterisk (\*\*) in this list add effects to a rogue's sneak
attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual
attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.

*Assault Leader (Ex)*: Once per day, when the rogue misses with an
attack on a flanked opponent, she can designate a single ally who is
also flanking the target that her attack missed. That ally can make a
single melee attack against the opponent as an immediate action.

*Befuddling Strike\*\* (Ex)*: When the rogue deals sneak attack damage
against an opponent, that opponent takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls
against the rogue for 1d4 rounds.

*Camouflage (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can craft
simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The rogue
needs 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is good
for the rest of the day or until the rogue fails a saving throw against
an area effect spell that deals fire, cold, or acid damage, whichever
comes first. The rogue gains a +4 bonus on
[Stealth] checks while within
terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This
ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage.

*Canny Observer (Ex)*: When a rogue with this talent makes a
[Perception] check to hear the
details of a conversation or to find concealed or secret objects
(including doors and traps), she gains a +4 bonus.

*Charmer (Ex)*: Once per day, the rogue can roll two dice while making a
[Diplomacy] check, and take the
better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the
[Diplomacy] check. A rogue can
use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels
she possesses.

*Coax Information (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can use
[Bluff] or
[Diplomacy] in place of
[Intimidate] to force an
opponent to act friendly toward her.

*Combat Swipe*: A rogue who selects this talent gains [Improved Steal]) as a bonus feat.

*Cunning Trigger (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can use a swift action
to set off any trap within 30 feet that she constructed.

*Distracting Attack\*\* (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can make sneak
attacks with subtle flourishes that disorient and distract her enemy.
When she hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack
damage, she can forgo the additional damage to cause the creature to
become flat-footed against one target of her choosing until the
beginning of her next turn. The rogue cannot designate herself as the
creature gaining the benefit of this talent. Creatures with uncanny
dodge are immune to distracting attack.

*Expert Leaper (Ex)*: When making jump checks, the rogue is always
considered to have a running start. Also, when the rogue deliberately
falls, a DC 15 [Acrobatics]
check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen, instead of the
first 10 feet.

*Fast Fingers (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can roll two
dice while making a [Sleight of Hand] check and take
the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the
[Sleight of Hand]
check. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for
every 5 rogue levels she possesses.

*Fast Getaway (Ex)*: After successfully making a sneak attack or
[Sleight of Hand]
check, a rogue with this talent can spend a move action to take the
withdraw action. She can move no more than her speed during this
movement.

*Fast Picks (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can use the [Disable Device] skill to
attempt to open a lock as a standard action instead of a full-round
action.

*Follow Clues (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can use
[Perception] to follow tracks
as per the [Survival] skill.

*Guileful Polyglot (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent who has at least one
rank in [Linguistics] gains
four additional languages. A rogue with this talent who does not have
any ranks in [Linguistics]
gains two additional languages. If the rogue later gains ranks in
[Linguistics], she gains two
additional languages, to a total of four additional languages above
those granted by the
[Linguistics] skill itself.

*Hard to Fool (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can roll two
dice while making a [Sense Motive] check, and take the
better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the
[Sense Motive] check. A
rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue
levels she possesses.

*Honeyed Words (Ex)*: Once per day, the rogue can roll two dice while
making a [Bluff] check, and take the
better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the
Bluff check. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day
for every five rogue levels she possesses.

*Lasting Poison (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a
weapon in such a way that it is effective for two successful attacks
instead of one. The poison has a reduced effect, however, and saves made
against the poison receive a +2 circumstance bonus. Applying poison in
this way requires a full-round action, or a standard action if the rogue
has the swift poison talent.

*Nimble Climber (Ex)*: When a rogue with this talent fails a
[Climb] check by 5 or more, she can
immediately make another [Climb] check
at the surface's base DC +10. If successful, she stops her fall by
clinging onto the surface. The rogue does not take falling damage when
she stops her fall in this manner.

*Offensive Defense\*\* (Ex)*: When a rogue with this talent hits a
creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the rogue
gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each sneak attack die rolled for 1
round.

*Peerless Maneuver (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can
roll two dice while making an
[Acrobatics] check, and take
the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the
[Acrobatics] check. A rogue
can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue
levels she possesses.

*Positioning Attack (Ex)*: Once per day, when a rogue with this talent
hits a creature with a melee attack, she can move up to 30 feet without
provoking attacks of opportunity. The movement must end in a space
adjacent to the creature hit with the melee attack.

*Powerful Sneak\*\* (Ex)*: Whenever a rogue with this talent takes a
full attack action, she can elect to take a -2 penalty on all attack
rolls until the start of her next turn. If an attack during this time is
a sneak attack, she treats all 1s on the sneak attack damage dice as 2s.

*Quick Disguise (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can use the items at
hand and seemingly innocuous material hidden on her person to create
startlingly effective disguises, reducing the amount of time it takes to
create a disguise using the
[Disguise] skill.

The time needed for the rogue to alter her appearance in this manner is
based on the complexity of the disguise, as noted on the following
table. The times are cumulative, so if a female rogue wants to disguise
herself as a male of a different race, that takes 2 minutes.

  Disguise                                              Time
  ----------------------------------------------------- -------------------
  Minor details only                                    1 full-round action
  [Disguise] as a different gender          1 minute
  [Disguise] as a different race            1 minute
  [Disguise] as a different age category    1 minute
  [Disguise] as a different size category   1 minute

*Quick Trapsmith (Ex)*: As a full-round action, a rogue with this talent
can set a simple trap with a CR no greater than 1/2 her rogue level. To
do this, she must purchase the components, spend the required time
constructing the trap in advance, and have its components at hand. The
type of trap that can be constructed in this way is subject to GM
discretion.

*Snap Shot (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent may treat her intitiative
roll as a 20 for a surprise round, regardless of her initiative, but she
may only take an attack action with a ranged weapon. Her normal
initiative roll is used in subsequent rounds. If two or more rogues
possess this talent, their initiative determines the order in which they
act, but they all go before any other creature. If a rogue is prevented
from acting in the surprise round, this talent has no effect.

*Sniper's Eye (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can apply her sneak attack
damage on ranged attacks targeting foes within 30 feet that benefit from
concealment. Foes with total concealment are still immune.

*Strong Impression*: A rogue who selects this talent gains [Intimidating Prowess] as a bonus feat.

*Survivalist*: A rogue with this talent adds
[Heal] and
[Survival] to her list of class
skills.

*Swift Poison (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a
weapon as a move action, instead of a standard action.

**Advanced Rogue Talents**: The following new advanced rogue talents can
be selected by any rogue of 10th level or higher who meets the
prerequisites.

*Another Day (Ex)*: Once per day, when the rogue would be reduced to 0
or fewer hit points by a melee attack, she can take a 5-foot step as an
immediate action. If the movement takes her out of the reach of the
attack, she takes no damage from the attack. The rogue is staggered for
1 round on her next turn.

*Deadly Cocktail (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can apply two doses of
poison to a weapon at once. These can be separate poisons, in which case
they both affect the target individually, or two doses of the same
toxin, in which case the poisons' frequency is extended by 50% and the
save DC increases by +2. This talent is an exception to the rule that
injury poisons can only be delivered one dose at a time.

*Deadly Sneak\*\* (Ex)*: Whenever a rogue with this talent uses the
powerful sneak rogue talent, she treats all 1s and 2s on the sneak
attack damage dice as 3s. A rogue must have the powerful sneak rogue
talent before choosing this talent.

*Entanglement of Blades\*\* (Ex)*: When a rogue with this talent hits a
creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the target
cannot take a 5-foot step until the beginning of the rogue's next turn.

*Fast Tumble (Ex)*: When a rogue with this talent uses
[Acrobatics] to move at full
speed through a threatened square without provoking an attack of
opportunity, the DC of the
[Acrobatics] check does not
increase by 10.

*Frugal Trapsmith (Ex)*: When a rogue with this talent constructs a
mechanical trap, she only pays 75% of the normal cost.

*Hunter's Surprise (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can
designate a single enemy she is adjacent to as her prey. Until the end
of her next turn, she can add her sneak attack damage to all attacks
made against her prey, even if she is not flanking it or it is not
flat-footed.

*Knock-Out Blow (Ex)*: Once per day, the rogue can forgo her sneak
attack damage to attempt to knock out an opponent. She must declare the
use of knock-out blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits,
it does normal damage, but instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and
instead of any effect that triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack
damage), the target falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful
Fortitude save reduces this effect to staggered for 1 round. The DC of
this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's
Intelligence modifier.

*Master of Disguise (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this talent gains
a +10 bonus on a single [Disguise]
check.

*Redirect Attack (Ex)*: Once per day, when a rogue with this talent is
hit with a melee attack, she can redirect the attack to strike at an
adjacent creature with a free action. The creature targeted must be
within melee reach of the attack that hit the rogue, and the creature
that made the attack against the rogue must make a new attack roll
against the new target.

*Stealthy Sniper (Ex)*: When a rogue with this talent uses the
[Stealth] skill to snipe, she only
suffers a -10 penalty on the
[Stealth] check, instead of -20.

*Thoughtful Reexamining (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this talent
can reroll a [Knowledge], [Sense Motive], or
[Perception] skill check to
try to gain new or better information from the roll. This reroll can be
made any time during the same day as the original check.

### Acrobat

Agility and daring are both excellent rogue traits, and their confluence
can create spectacular feats of acrobatics. Whether they are daring
thieves, infiltrating assassins, or intrepid spies, proper training in
acrobatics is a valuable boon for rogues.

**Expert Acrobat (Ex)**: At 1st level, an acrobat does not suffer any
armor check penalties on
[Acrobatics],
[Climb],
[Fly], [Sleight of Hand], or
[Stealth] skill checks while wearing
light armor. When she is not wearing armor, she gains a +2 competency
bonus on [Acrobatics] and
[Fly] skill checks. This ability replaces
trapfinding.

**Second Chance (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an acrobat can reroll any
[Acrobatics],
[Climb], or
[Fly] skill check she has just made. This
reroll is made at a -5 penalty. She must take the second result, even if
it is worse. An acrobat can use this ability only once on any given
skill check. She can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus
one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability
replaces trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the acrobat
archetype: expert leaper, ledge walker\*, nimble climber, peerless
maneuver, rogue crawl\*, and stand up\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the acrobat archetype: defensive roll\*, fast getaway, fast tumble, and
improved evasion\*.

### Burglar

Adept at infiltration, trap removal, and lock picking, burglars prey on
the homes of the wealthy and forgotten tombs alike. Such riches are
guarded with vicious traps and hazards, but the devious mind of the
burglar allows her to find such dangers and avoid them.

**Careful Disarm (Ex)**: At 4th level, whenever a burglar attempts to
disarm a trap using [Disable Device], she does not
spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a
trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus
to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Distraction (Ex)**: At 8th level, whenever a burglar is detected while
using [Stealth], she can immediately
attempt a [Bluff] skill check opposed by
the [Sense Motive] skill of
the creature that spotted her. If this check succeeds, the target
assumes that the noise was something innocent and disregards the
detection. This only functions if the creature cannot see the rogue.
This ability can only be used once during a given
[Stealth] attempt. If the same
creature detects the rogue's presence again, the ability has no effect.
This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the burglar
archetype: fast picks, fast stealth\*, nimble climber, quick disable\*,
and trap spotter\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the burglar archetype: knock-out blow, skill mastery\*, and thoughtful
reexamining.

### Cutpurse

Everyone who lives in the city understands that a wealthy man stays
wealthy by guarding his purse while wandering the streets and markets.
Cutpurses are often trained by guilds to collect the guild's tax from
local businesses on a daily basis, whether through intimidation or
pickpocketing. Some find themselves taking up the mantle of adventurer,
and their talents are generally appreciated in this role, but the
cutpurse is still the first person her companions look to when an item
goes missing.

**Measure the Mark (Ex)**: When a cutpurse makes a [Sleight of Hand] check to take
something from a creature, the target makes its
[Perception] check before the
rogue makes her [Sleight of Hand] check, and the
rogue knows the [Perception]
check result. She can decide whether or not to make the check based on
the results of the target's
[Perception] check. If the
rogue elects not to make the check, she can make a
[Bluff] check, opposed by the target's
[Sense Motive], to prevent
the target from noticing the attempt. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Stab and Grab (Ex)**: At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a cutpurse
can make an attack and also make a [Sleight of Hand] check to steal
something from the target of the attack. If the attack deals sneak
attack damage, the rogue can use [Sleight of Hand] to take an item
from the creature during combat; otherwise this ability can only be used
in a surprise round before the target has acted. If the attack is
successful, the target takes a -5 penalty on the
[Perception] check to notice
the theft. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the cutpurse
archetype: combat swipe, fast fingers, fast getaway, hard to fool, minor
magic\*, slow reactions\*, and surprise attack\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the cutpurse archetype: crippling strike\*, fast tumble, and skill
mastery\*.

### Investigator

Not all rogues work against the law. Investigators use their skills to
serve the law, often in the employ of nobles or in the pursuit of noble
causes. In some cities cabals of investigators work for rulers or
bureaucracies, but often an investigator is a free agent who pursues
whatever mysteries come across her path. Of course, not all
investigators serve the law. Crime lords and guildmasters often have
squads of investigators serving their own nefarious purposes.

**Follow Up (Ex)**: An investigator can roll twice on any
[Diplomacy] check made to gather
information, and receives the information for both results. This takes
the same amount of time as one check. If the lesser of the two checks
reveals false information, the rogue is aware of it. False information
is not revealed in this way if the people she questioned do not know it
to be false. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the
investigator archetype: coax information, fast picks, follow clues, hard
to fool, and minor magic\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the investigator archetype: hunter's surprise, slippery mind\*, and
thought reexamining.

### Poisoner

Some consider poisoning an evil act. The poisoner knows poison is just a
tool toward an end, and is no different than any other weapon. Some
poisoners see themselves as great equalizers, as they are able to craft
weapons that the weakest of creatures can wield to devastating effect,
but most have no lofty delusions about their work.

**Poison Use (Ex)**: At 1st level, a poisoner is trained in the use of
poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a
blade. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Master Poisoner (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a poisoner can use
[Craft] (alchemy) to change the type of
a poison. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist's lab and a
[Craft] (alchemy) skill check with a DC
equal to the poison's DC. If successful, the poison's type changes to
contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the check fails, the poison is
ruined. The poisoner also receives a bonus on
[Craft] (alchemy) skill checks when
working with poison equal to 1/2 her rogue level. This ability replaces
trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the poisoner
archetype: distracting attack, lasting poison, surprise attack\*, swift
poison, and weapon training\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the poisoner archetype: deadly cocktail, hunter's surprise, and
opportunist\*.

### Rake

The rake is a rogue who is open about her skills and talents, often to
the point of being boastful. Usually she has the protection of an
important figure who finds her services useful, but sometimes her
bravado is enough to keep enemies away. She is often used as a face for
the group for diplomacy, gathering information, negotiations, or to gain
the most lucrative contracts and quests from local authorities.

**Bravado's Blade (Ex)**: When a rake hits an opponent and deals sneak
attack damage, she can forgo 1d6 points of that damage and make a free
[Intimidate] check to
demoralize the foe. For every additional 1d6 points of sneak attack
damage she forgoes, she receives a +5 circumstance bonus on this check.
This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Rake's Smile (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a rake gains a +1 morale bonus on
[Bluff] and
[Diplomacy] checks. This bonus
increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces
trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the rake
archetype: befuddling strike, charmer, honeyed words, and surprise
attack\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the rake archetype: another day, redirect attack, and skill mastery\*.

### Scout

Not all rogues live in the city. Scouts frequently roam the wilderness,
often banding together as bandits, but sometimes serving as guides, as
trailblazers, or as companions to a ranger or barbarian warrior. More
comfortable with sneaking and hiding outdoors, the scout is still
effective in the city and the dungeon.

**Scout's Charge (Ex)**: At 4th level, whenever a scout makes a charge,
her attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target were flat-footed.
Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. This ability
replaces uncanny dodge.

**Skirmisher (Ex)**: At 8th level, whenever a scout moves more than 10
feet in a round and makes an attack action, the attack deals sneak
attack damage as if the target was flat-footed. If the scout makes more
than one attack this turn, this ability only applies to the first
attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. This ability
replaces improved uncanny dodge.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the scout
archetype: assault leader, camouflage, cunning trigger, survivalist, and
trap spotter\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the scout archetype: hunter's surprise, skill mastery\*, and stealthy
sniper.

### Sniper

Some say that the sniper is the worst kind of assassin: a killer who
waits silently in the shadows and then strikes from a distance without
remorse. Snipers, of course, understand that such protestations about
“cowardice” and “honor” regarding their profession are in fact merely
the bleatings of sheep fearing the slaughter and pay them no heed. Most
snipers take pride in their formidable abilities, which allow them to
take life quickly, quietly, and efficiently, then disappear into their
surroundings without a trace.

**Accuracy (Ex)**: At 1st level, a sniper halves all range increment
penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow or crossbow. This
ability replaces trapfinding.

**Deadly Range (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a sniper increases the range at
which she can apply her sneak attack damage by 10 feet. This range
increases by 10 feet for every 3 levels after 3rd. This ability replaces
trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the sniper
archetype: camouflage, snap shot, sniper's eye, and weapon training\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the sniper archetype: defensive roll\*, master of disguise, and stealthy
sniper.

### Spy

The best spies are like chameleons, but not only can they change their
appearances to fit the situation, they can also change their
personalities, allegiances, and even loves if that's what it takes to
achieve their clandestine goals. Spies are the ultimate manipulators,
and even those who commission their services sometimes find that they've
merely served the spies' own interests.

**Skilled Liar (Ex)**: Whenever a spy uses
[Bluff] to attempt to deceive someone,
she gains a bonus on the opposed roll equal to 1/2 her rogue level
(minimum +1). This bonus does not apply to feint attempts or attempts to
pass secret messages. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Poison Use (Ex)**: A 3rd level, a spy is trained in the use of poison
and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a blade.
This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the spy
archetype: canny observer, guileful polyglot, honeyed words, major
magic\*, minor magic\*, and quick disguise.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the spy archetype: crippling strike\*, master of disguise, and stealthy
sniper.

### Swashbuckler

A paragon of mobile swordplay, the swashbuckler is a rogue who focuses
almost exclusively on honing her skill at arms and perfecting daring
acrobatic moves and elaborate flourishes that border on performance.

**Martial Training (Ex)**: At 1st level, the swashbuckler may select one
martial weapon to add to her list of weapon proficiencies. In addition,
she may take the combat trick rogue talent up to two times. This ability
replaces trapfinding.

**Daring (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a swashbuckler gains a +1 morale bonus on
[Acrobatics] checks and saving
throws against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels
beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the
swashbuckler archetype: offensive defense, positioning attack, powerful
sneak, and weapon training\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the swashbuckler archetype: crippling strike\*, entanglement of blades,
and redirect attack.

### Thug

Some criminals steal with finesse, their victims only discovering the
crime when the rogue is long gone and the coin already spent. A thug, on
the other hand, cares nothing for finesse. Through both threat and
violence, the thug gets what she wants by the promise of force, and has
no problem making good on that promise as needed.

**Frightening (Ex)**: Whenever a thug successfully uses
[Intimidate] to demoralize a
creature, the duration of the shaken condition is increased by 1 round.
In addition, if the target is shaken for 4 or more rounds, the thug can
instead decide to make the target frightened for 1 round. This ability
replaces trapfinding.

**Brutal Beating (Ex)**: At 3rd level, whenever a thug deals sneak
attack damage, she can choose to forgo 1d6 points of sneak attack damage
to make the target sickened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her
rogue level. This ability does not stack with itself—only the most
recent duration applies. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the thug
archetype: offensive defense, powerful sneak, strong impression, and
weapon training\*.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the thug archetype: crippling strike\*, deadly sneak, and knock-out
blow.

### Trapsmith

Some rogues are not content with just disabling traps—they love to build
them, finding a captivating beauty in the turning of gears and the
slither of ropes over pulleys. The trapsmith may have started out
putting together traps in order to better understand how to disable
them, but for most, it's long since gone beyond that—they now relish the
challenge of creating the perfect combat machine.

**Careful Disarm (Ex)**: At 4th level, whenever a trapsmith attempts to
disarm a trap using [Disable Device], she does not
spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a
trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus
to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Trap Master (Ex)**: At 8th level, whenever a trapsmith disarms a trap
using [Disable Device],
she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more.
If it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without
danger, she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her
allies and restricting enemies if she desires. This ability replaces
improved uncanny dodge.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the trapsmith
archetype: befuddling strike, cunning trigger, quick disable\*, and
quick trapsmith.

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement
the trapsmith archetype: another day, frugal trapsmith, and skill
mastery\*.


## Sorcerer

Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so
much a calling as a blessing—or a curse. For some sorcerers, this arcane
birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting
in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For
others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing
out of a power greater than themselves. Presented below are a number of
new bloodlines representing the mysterious origin of your sorcerer's
abilities.

New spells presented in Chapter 5 are marked here with asterisks (\*).

### Aquatic

Your family traces its heritage back to the ocean depths, whether scions
of undersea empires left in the wake of nomadic sea-tribes, or the spawn
of creeping ichthyic infiltrators into remote seaside villages. The song
of the sea hums in your blood, calling the waves and all those within to
your command.

**Class Skill**: [Swim].

**Bonus Spells**: *[Hydraulic Push]\**(3rd),
*[Slipstream]\**(5th), *[Aqueous Orb]\**(7th),
*[Geyser]\**(9th), *[Control Water]*(11th), *[Beast
Shape IV]*(13th), *[Summon Monster VII]*(15th),
*[Seamantle]\**(17th), *[World Wave]\**(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Athletic], [Brew Potion], [Defensive Combat Training],
[Dodge],
[Mobility], [Silent Spell], [Skill Focus]
([Swim]),
[Toughness].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the water type, your
effective caster level is increased by one, and summoned creatures with
a swim speed or the aquatic or water type gain a +1 morale bonus on
attack and damage rolls.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your seaborn magical talents awaken changes in
you, both mystical and physical, as you develop your powers.

*Dehydrating Touch (Sp)*: Starting at 1st level, you can make a melee
touch attack as a standard action that inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal
damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess and sickens the
target for 1 round. Oozes, plants, and creatures with the aquatic or
water subtypes suffer lethal damage instead. You can use this ability a
number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Aquatic Adaptation (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain a swim speed of 30
feet. At 9th level, you gain the amphibious special quality and develop
a fat layer that grants a +1 natural armor bonus and resist cold 5. When
immersed in water, you gain blindsense 30 feet. At 15th level, you gain
a swim speed of 60 feet and blindsense of 60 feet in water.

*Aquatic Telepathy (Su)*: At 9th level, you gain telepathy (100 feet)
and can communicate with creatures with a swim speed or the aquatic or
water types regardless of intelligence. You may cast
*[Suggestion]*on such
creatures a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.
This ability is telepathic and does not require audible or visual
components. At 15th level, once per day you can telepathically call and
request a service from an aquatic, water, or swimming creature as if
using *[Demand]*or *[Greater Planar Ally]*.

*Raise the Deep (Sp)*: At 15th level, you raise water as per *[Control Water]*, but no water
need be present. This created water is stationary and does not flow out
of the area where you create it; it lasts 1 round per sorcerer level and
then disappears. At 20th level, the dimensions of the effect are
doubled. You may use this ability once per day.

*Deep One (Ex)*: At 20th level, you gain blindsense 60 feet and your
body is covered with fine, slippery scales granting DR 10/piercing,
resist cold 20, and continuous *[Freedom of Movement]*.
Underwater, you gain evasion and blindsight 120 feet, and you are immune
to pressure damage from deep water.

### Boreal

Descended from inhabitants of the lands of ice and snow, you count among
your ancestors giant-kin, troll-born, and frost-rimed spirits. Their
savage and raw energies flow down through generations to infuse you to
the marrow with the chill of the polar wind, crackling auroras, and the
long winter's night.

**Class Skill**: [Survival].

**Bonus Spells**: *[Enlarge person]*(3rd),
*[Rage]*(5th), *[Elemental Aura]\**(Cold Only) (7th),
*[Wall of Ice]*(9th), *[Cone
of Cold]*(11th),
*[Transformation]*(13th),
*[Giant Form I]*(15th),
*[Polar Ray]*(17th), *[Meteor Swarm]*(Dealing Cold
Damage) (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Arcane Strike],
[Diehard], [Empower Spell],
[Endurance], [Exotic Weapon Proficiency], [Power Attack], [Skill Focus]
([Intimidate]),
[Toughness].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell with the cold
descriptor, increase the spell's save DC by 1.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your connection to primeval winters grants you a
mastery of cold magic that few can match, and a savagery that fewer
still can withstand.

*Cold Steel (Sp)*: At 1st level, you can touch a weapon or up to 50
pieces of ammunition as a standard action, giving it the
*[Frost]* property for a
number of rounds equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). At 9th
level, you can confer the *[Icy Burst]* property
instead, but the duration of the power is halved. You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Icewalker (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain resist cold 5 and can move
across snow and icy surfaces without penalty and without leaving tracks.
At 9th level, you gain resist cold 10 and can climb icy surfaces as if
using *[Spider Climb].*

*Snow Shroud (Su)*: At 9th level, you ignore concealment and
[Perception] penalties in
natural or magical snow, ice, fog, and similar weather conditions. In
addition, you can surround yourself with a cloak of swirling snow for a
number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. This power acts
and deals damage as a *[Fire Shield] (chill [Shield])* that sheds no light. It
provides a 20% miss chance on attacks made against you and grants a
bonus on [Stealth] checks equal to
1/2 your sorcerer level in snowy or icy areas. You can use this ability
once per day at 9th level, twice per day at 17th, and three times per
day at 20th.

*Blizzard (Sp)*: At 15th level, you can create a savage winter storm
centered on you. This power acts as *[Control Winds]*, but in addition
the entire area (not including the “eye” at the center of the storm) is
affected as a *[Sleet Storm]*
and all in the area are exposed to [Extreme Cold]. You may use this ability
once per day.

*Child of Ancient Winters (Su)*: At 20th level, you gain the cold
subtype and you become immune to fatigue and exhaustion. In addition,
you gain immunity to sneak attacks and critical hits. This power causes
you to gain vulnerability to fire.

### Deep Earth

The echoing cave-songs and the rumble and creak of primal spirits deep
below the ground thrum in your soul and in all your family line. You are
likely slow, steady, and stable in your thinking, little prone to
wandering and preferring to instead find depth in contemplation.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge]
(dungeoneering).

**Bonus Spells**: *[Expeditious Excavation]\**(3rd),
*[Darkvision]*(5th),
*[Shifting Sand]\**(7th),
*[Stoneskin]*(9th), *[Spike Stones]*(11th), *[Stone Tell]*(13th), *[Repel Metal or Stone]*(15th),
*[Earthquake]*(17th),
*[Clashing Rocks]\**(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Acrobatic Steps],
[Alertness],
[Blind-Fight], [Forge Ring], [Nimble Moves], [Skill Focus]
([Perception]),
[Stealthy], [Still Spell].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you and the target of your spell are both
underground, increase the spell's save DC by +1.

**Bloodline Powers**: The powers of the living rock are within you, and
your communion with the strength of stone is refined and enhanced as
your power grows.

*Tremor (Sp)*: At 1st level, as a standard action, you can cause the
ground to shake beneath a single creature within 30 feet, functioning as
a trip maneuver using your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier in
place of your CMB. You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Rockseer (Su)*: At 3rd level, you gain the stonecunning trait as a
dwarf; if already a dwarf, your bonus improves to +4. At 9th level, you
gain tremorsense 30 feet. At 15th level, you can see through solid
objects as if using a *[Ring of X-ray Vision]* for a number
of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds do not need
to be consecutive.

*Crystal Shard (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can touch a metal or stone
weapon (or up to 50 pieces of ammunition) as a standard action, giving
it the *[Bane]* property
against any creature with the earth subtype, oozes, or constructs made
of stone or metal, for 1 minute. You can use this ability once per day
at 9th level, twice per day at 17th, and three times per day at 20th.

*Earth [Glide] (Ex)*: At 15th level, you
can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish
swims through water, with a burrow speed equal to half your normal
speed. You do not leave a tunnel or trace of your passage. You can use
this ability for 1 minute per sorcerer level each day. The duration need
not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

*Strength of Stone (Su)*: At 20th level, your flesh becomes as hard as
stone, giving you DR 10/adamantine, and you become immune to
petrification. You suffer no penalties while squeezing through tight
spaces and are immune to bull rush, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip
maneuvers, and to push and pull effects as long as you are standing on
the ground.

### Dreamspun

Your family is a long line of dreamers, who dream not as ordinary
mortals do but rather as those who reach through and touch the supernal
realm of dreams and the farthest shores of night. Whether it is a gift
or curse is not always clear, but your visions of the past and future
call you ineluctably to a life of adventure.

**Class Skill**: [Sense Motive].

**Bonus Spells**: *[Sleep]*(3rd),
*[Augury]*(5th), *[Deep Slumber]*(7th),
*[Divination]*(9th),
*[Dream]*(11th), *[Shadow Walk]*(13th),
*[Vision]*(15th), *[Moment of Prescience]*(17th),
*[Astral Projection]*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Alertness],
[Blind-Fight], [Combat Expertise],
[Deceitful], [Heighten Spell], [Improved Feint],
[Persuasive], [Skill Focus] ([Sense Motive]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you target a single creature with a
spell, you gain an insight bonus equal to half the spell's level
(minimum +1) for 1 round to your AC and saving throws against any spell
or attack made by that creature.

**Bloodline Powers**: You reach out into and through the world of dreams
to touch the minds and destinies of those around you.

*[Lullaby] (Sp)*: At 1st level, you
can use *[Lullaby]*as a spell-like
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.
This effect lasts for 1 minute and does not require concentration. The
penalty on saves versus sleep effects increases to -4.

*Combat Precognition (Su)*: Your insight into the future grants you an
advantage in combat. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you
gain a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks.

*Dreamshaper (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can manipulate the dreamscape of
others, drawing forth or tampering with their subconscious minds. This
power allows you to tamper with the target's memories as if using
*[Modify Memory],*or you
may ask questions as if using *[Speak with Dead]*upon a corpse. A
successful Will save negates the effect. The DC of this save is equal to
10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier, with further
modifiers as the
*[Nightmare]*spell. You can use
this ability once per day at 9th level. At 17th level you can use this
ability twice per day, and at 20th, three times per day.

*Eye of Somnus (Sp)*: At 15th level, you can project your consciousness
as if using *[Arcane Eye]*. In
addition, at any point you can cause the *[Arcane Eye]*to become visible. The eye
can no longer be moved, but it acts as a *[Symbol of Sleep]*to all who see
it. You may use this power once per day.

*Solipsism (Ex)*: At 20th level, you can drift into the dream world,
fading from the world around you. You can become incorporeal for 1
minute per sorcerer level. You gain the incorporeal subtype and take
only half damage from corporeal magical attacks (you take no damage from
nonmagical weapons and objects). Your spells deal only half damage to
corporeal creatures, but spells and abilities that do not deal damage
function normally. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be
used in 1-minute increments.

### Protean

You have in your veins the ever-changing wildness of primal chaos, the
raw essence of unbound creation. Your mind and spirit burst with the
constant inspiration of consummate freedom, though you have difficulty
following through on a task when another, new and exciting, catches your
interest.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge]
(planes).

**Bonus Spells**: *[Entropic Shield]*(3rd),
*[Blur]*(5th), *[Gaseous Form]*(7th),
*[Confusion]*(9th), *[Major Creation]*(11th),
*[Disintegrate]*(13th),
*[Greater Polymorph]*(15th),
*[Polymorph Any Object]*(17th),
*[Shapechange]*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Agile Maneuvers],
[Defensive Combat Training], [Enlarge Spell], [Great Fortitude], [Improved Great Fortitude], [Skill Focus]
([Craft] [any]), [Spell Focus],
[Toughness].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Your magic of creation and changing is hard to
unravel. The DC to dispel transmutation or conjuration (creation) spells
that you cast is increased by +4.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your ancestral immersion in primordial chaos
begets your curiously warped magical talents.

*Protoplasm (Sp)*: At 1st level, you can create a ball of entropic
protoplasm and hurl it at targets within 30 feet. This protoplasm acts
as a tanglefoot bag that also inflicts 1 point of acid damage per round
to a creature entangled by it. The protoplasm dissolves within 1d3
rounds. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
your Charisma modifier.

*Protean Resistances (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain resist acid 5 and a
+2 bonus on saving throws against polymorph, petrification, and
transmutation spells or effects. At 9th level, you gain resist acid 10
and your save bonus increases to +4.

*Reality Wrinkle (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can surround yourself with a
mobile, 10-foot-radius emanation of mutable reality. This rippling
distortion is similar to *[Solid Fog]* but does not provide
concealment or block line of sight. Your movement is not slowed by this
aura. Attacks from outside the aura suffer a 20% miss chance against
targets inside the aura. You may use this ability a number of rounds per
day equal to your sorcerer level, though this duration need not be
continuous.

*Spatial Tear (Sp)*: At 15th level, once per day, you can unravel the
fibers of reality and ride along them as they snap back into place. This
power functions as *[Dimension Door],*while also creating a mass of *[Black Tentacles]*centered
on your former location. Both of these effects use your sorcerer level
as the caster level. At 20th level, you can use this ability twice per
day.

*Avatar of Chaos (Ex)*: At 20th level, you are infused with the essence
of raw chaos. You gain immunity to acid, petrification, and polymorph
effects (except when cast on self), as well as a +2 bonus to save DCs
and on checks to overcome spell penetration against creatures with the
lawful subtype.

### Serpentine

Your bloodline carries the lingering stain of ancient serpent races that
ruled when the world was young; your forebears were likely favored
slaves anointed by their reptilian masters and gifted with their cold
cunning and subtle manipulation. While deception and a mesmeric charm
are your birthright, you may struggle for truth in spite of your
heritage.

**Class Skill**: [Diplomacy].

**Bonus Spells**:
*[Hypnotism]*(3rd), *[Delay Poison]*(5th), *[Summon
Monster Iii]*(Reptiles
Only) (7th), *[Poison]*(9th), *[Hold Monster]*(11th), *[Mass Suggestion]*(13th),
*[Summon Monster VII]*(Reptiles
Only) (15th), *[Irresistible Dance]*(17th),
*[Dominate Monster]*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Combat Casting],
[Combat Reflexes],
[Deceitful], [Deft Hands],
[Persuasive], [Silent Spell], [Skill Focus]
([Bluff]),
[Stealthy].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Your powers of compulsion can affect even bestial
creatures. Whenever you cast a mind-affecting or language-dependent
spell, it affects animals, magical beasts, and monstrous humanoids as if
they were humanoids who understood your language.

**Bloodline Powers**: The treacherous and yet hypnotic serpent's blood
that flows through you taints your magic with a sinuous and seductive
grace.

*Serpent's Fang (Ex)*: At 1st level, you can grow fangs as a free
action. These fangs are treated as a natural weapon inflicting 1d4
points of damage plus your Strength modifier (1d3 if you are Small) plus
poison (Bite—injury; *save* Fort DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your
Constitution modifier; *frequency*1/round for 6 rounds; *effect*1 Con
damage; *cure*1 save). At 5th level, these fangs are considered magical
for the purpose of overcoming DR and the poison damage increases to 1d2
Con. At 7th level, your poison requires 2 successful saves to cure. At
11th level, your poison damage increases to 1d4 Con. You can use your
fangs for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma
modifier.

*Serpentfriend (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you can use *[Speak with Animals]*at will
with reptilian animals (including various forms of dinosaurs, lizards,
and other cold-blooded creatures), and you gain a viper familiar using
your sorcerer level -2 as your effective wizard level.

*Snakeskin (Ex)*: At 9th level, you gain a +1 bonus to natural armor, a
+2 racial bonus on saves against poison, and a +2 bonus on [Escape Artist] checks. At 13th
level and 17th level, these bonuses increase by +1.

*Den of Vipers (Sp)*: At 15th level, you may summon a host of writhing
serpents. This power acts as *[Creeping Doom],*but the swarms'
poison inflicts Con damage and any creature other than you sharing a
space with a swarm is entangled.

*Scaled Soul (Su)*: At 20th level, you gain the shapechanger subtype,
and you can assume the form of a reptilian humanoid (as *[Alter Self]*) or snake of Diminutive to Huge size (as *[Beast Shape III]*) at will. You
retain the power of speech and the ability to use somatic spell
components when transformed. You also become immune to poison and
paralysis. You may use serpent's fang as often as desired, and you may
choose to inflict damage to any ability score.

### Shadow

Spirits from the shadow plane dally at times in the world of light, and
such as these lay with your ancestors once upon a time, imparting the
mystery of shadow-stuff into your lineage. You are often sullen and
withdrawn, preferring to skulk at the fringes of social circles and keep
to yourself, cultivating an air of mystery and majesty that is all your
own.

**Class Skill**: [Stealth].

**Bonus Spells**: *[Ray of Enfeeblement]*(3rd),
*[Darkvision]*(5th), *[Deeper Darkness]*(7th),
*[Shadow Conjuration]*(9th),
*[Shadow Evocation]*(11th),
*[Shadow Walk]*(13th),
*[Power Word Blind]*(15th),
*[Greater Evocation]*(17th), *[Shades]*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Acrobatic],
[Blind-Fight],
[Dodge], [Quick Draw], [Silent Spell], [Skill Focus]
([Stealth]),
[Stealthy], [Weapon Finesse].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell with the darkness
descriptor or the shadow subschool, you gain a circumstance bonus on
[Stealth] checks equal to the
spell's level for 1d4 rounds.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your benighted heritage infuses your mastery of
magic with the essence of shadowstuff.

*Shadowstrike (Sp)*: At 1st level, you can make a melee touch attack as
a standard action that inflicts 1d4 points of nonlethal damage + 1 for
every two sorcerer levels you possess. In addition, the target is
dazzled for 1 minute. Creatures with low-light vision or darkvision are
not dazzled by this ability. You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Nighteye (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain darkvision 30 feet. At 9th
level, you gain darkvision 60 feet. If you already possess darkvision,
its range is increased by these amounts.

*[Shadow] Well (Sp)*: At 9th
level, you can use the [Stealth]
skill even while being observed and without cover or concealment, as
long as you are within 10 feet of a shadow other than your own. In
addition, when within an area of darkness or dim light, as a standard
action you may choose to switch places with a willing ally within 60
feet, who must also be in darkness or dim light. At 13th level, you can
instead switch the positions of two willing allies, each of whom must be
within 60 feet of you. Unless otherwise noted, this travel is identical
to *[Dimension Door]*.
You may use the ability to switch places once per day at 9th level, plus
one additional time per day at 17th level and 20th level.

*Enveloping Darkness (Sp)*: At 15th level, you may create an area of
*[Deeper Darkness]*
that you can see through without penalty. All creatures except you are
entangled within this darkness unless using *[Freedom of Movement]*or a
similar effect. You may use this ability once per day.

*[Shadow] Master (Su)*: At
20th level, you can see perfectly in natural or magical darkness. When
you use *[Shadow Conjuration]* or *[Shadow Evocation]*spells,
your creations are 20% more real, and any creatures you create gain the
benefits of the [Augment Summoning]
feat.

### Starsoul

You come from a line of stargazers and explorers who delved deeply into
the darkness beyond the stars. In touching the void, the void touched
them, and your mind, spirit, and body yearn to span the gulf between
worlds.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge]
(nature).

**Bonus Spells**: *[Unseen Servant]*(3rd),
*[Glitterdust]*(5th),
*[Blink]*(7th), *[Call Lightning Storm]*(9th;
dealing fire damage, damage increased outdoors at night), *[Overland Flight]*(11th),
*[Repulsion]*(13th), *[Reverse Gravity]*(15th),
*[Greater Prying Eyes]*(17th),
*[Meteor Swarm]*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Blind-Fight], [Craft Rod],
[Endurance], [Improved Counterspell], [Improved Iron Will], [Iron Will],
[Quicken Spell], [Skill Focus] ([Perception]), [Toughness].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast an evocation spell, targets that
fail their saves are dazzled by tiny sparkling starlights for 1 round
per level of the spell.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your skyward gaze and communion with the heavens
focus and enhance your magical talents.

*Minute Meteors (Sp)*: At 1st level, you can summon a rain of tiny
meteorites as a standard action to fall in a 5-foot column, 30 feet
high, with a range of 30 feet. The meteors inflict 1d4 points of fire
damage + 1 per 2 sorcerer levels. A Reflex save negates this damage. The
save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma
modifier. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3
+ your Charisma modifier.

*Voidwalker (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain low-light vision and resist
cold and fire 5. At 9th level, you no longer need to breathe, as if
wearing a *[Necklace of Adaptation]*.

*Aurora Borealis (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can create a sheet of
cascading colors. This power acts as a *[Wall of Fire]*, but it inflicts cold
damage and does not radiate heat. However, one side of the aurora
designated by you fascinates creatures within 10 feet, up to a maximum
of 2 HD of creatures per sorcerer level. A Will save negates this
fascinate effect. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level +
your Charisma modifier. You may use this ability for a number of rounds
per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds do not need to be
consecutive.

*Breaching the Gulf (Sp)*: At 15th level, your caster level is increased
by 3 when casting spells of the teleportation subschool. In addition,
once per day you can teleport a single creature within 30 feet into the
void of space if it fails a Will save. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2
your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. The target can attempt a
new saving throw as a full-round action each round to return. While
trapped in the airless void, the target takes 6d6 points of cold damage
per round and must hold its breath or begin to suffocate.

*Starborn (Ex)*: At 20th level, you gain immunity to cold and blindness,
and you can see perfectly in natural or magical darkness. In addition,
you gain fast healing 1 when you are outdoors at night.

### Stormborn

You trace your heritage to fierce and proud spirits of storm and sky,
and living lightning sings in your veins.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge]
(nature).

**Bonus Spells**: *[Shocking Grasp]*(3rd), *[Gust of Wind]*(5th), *[Lightning Bolt]*(7th),
*[Shout]*(9th), *[Overland Flight]*(11th),
*[Chain Lightning]*(13th),
*[Control Weather]*(15th),
*[Whirlwind]*(17th), *[Storm of Vengeance]*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Deadly Aim],
[Dodge], [Enlarge Spell], [Far Shot], [Great Fortitude], Point Blank Shot, [Skill Focus]
([Fly]), [Wind Stance].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell with the electricity or
sonic descriptor, increase the save DC by 1.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your mastery of the storm is reflected in the
unique panoply of powers you manifest.

*Thunderstaff (Sp)*: At 1st level, you can touch a weapon as a standard
action, giving it the
*[Shock]* property for a
number of rounds equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). At 9th
level, you can confer the *[Shocking Burst]* property
instead, but the duration of the power is halved. You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Stormchild (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain resist electricity 5 and
resist sonic 5, and treat wind effects as being one step less severe. At
9th level, you treat wind effects as being two steps less severe and
gain blindsense 60 feet against concealment from natural or magical fog,
mist, or weather effects.

*Thunderbolt (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can command a stroke of lightning
to strike from above in a 5-foot-radius cylinder 60 feet high. The
thunderbolt inflicts 1d6 points of damage per sorcerer level; half of
this damage is electricity and half is sonic. A Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2
your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) halves this damage.
Creatures failing their saves are deafened for 1 round. At 9th level,
you can use this ability once per day, at 17th twice per day, and at
20th three times per day. This power has a range of 120 feet.

*[Ride] the Lightning (Sp)*: At 15th
level, as a full-round action you can become a living lightning bolt and
move in a straight line up to 10 times your speed. You do not provoke
attacks of opportunity while moving in this way. Creatures or objects in
your path are affected as by your thunderbolt power. Creatures do not
block your movement but solid barriers do unless they are reduced to 0
hit points. You can use this power once per day for a number of rounds
equal to your sorcerer level.

*Storm Lord (Ex)*: At 20th level, you are one with the storm. You gain
immunity to deafness, stunning, and wind effects and gain blindsight 120
feet against concealment from natural or magical fog, mist, or weather.
Once per day, when attacked with an electricity or sonic effect, you may
forgo your saving throw and absorb the energies of the attack, healing 1
point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise
have dealt.

### Verdant

Your progenitors infused themselves with raw plant life, binding it into
their own tissue and passing it down to their literal seed, giving you
innate communion with nature.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge]
(nature).

**Bonus Spells**:
*[Entangle]*(3rd),
*[Barkskin]*(5th), *[Speak with Plants]*(7th),
*[Command Plants]*(9th), *[Wall of Thorns]*(11th),
*[Transport via Plants]*(13th),
*[Plant Shape III]*(15th), *[Animate Plants]*(17th),

**Bonus Feats**: [Acrobatic Steps],
[Craft Staff],
[Endurance], [Extend Spell],
[Fleet], [Nimble Moves], [Skill Focus]
([Knowledge] [nature]),
[Toughness].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell with a range of
personal, your skin toughens, granting you a natural armor bonus equal
to the spell's level for 1d4 rounds. This bonus does not stack with any
other natural armor bonuses you might have.

**Bloodline Powers**: The power of living things infuses every aspect of
your magic, as you draw power from nature and its life energies flow
through you.

*Tanglevine (Sp)*: At 1st level, as a standard action, you can create a
15-foot-long, animated vine that springs from your hand. This vine lasts
for 1 round and can be used to make a single disarm, steal, or trip
combat maneuver, using your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier
in place of your normal CMB. You can use this power a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Photosynthesis (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you feed upon nature's raw essence.
Your need to eat and sleep is reduced as if wearing a *[Ring of Sustenance]*, and you
gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws made against poison and sleep
effects. At 9th level, these bonuses increase to +4.

*Massmorph (Sp)*: At 9th level, as a full-round action, you can alter
the size and health of plant life, as if using *[Plant Growth]*or *[Diminish Plants]*.
Alternatively, you can transform one willing non-plant creature per
sorcerer level (no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart) as
*[Tree Shape]*. You may
transform creatures as *[Plant Shape I]*at 15th level, or
*[plant shape II]* at 20th level. You can transform non-plant creatures
using this power once per day.

*Rooting (Ex)*: At 15th level, as a move action, you can extend roots
into the ground. Your speed is reduced to 5 feet, but you gain a +4
bonus to natural armor and a +10 bonus to CMD against bull rush,
overrun, reposition, and trip maneuvers. You also gain tremorsense 30
feet and fast healing 1. You can use this power for a number of minutes
per day equal to your sorcerer level. This duration need not be
consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

*Shepherd of the Trees (Su)*: At 20th level, your verdant heritage fully
manifests. You gain a +4 natural armor bonus. You gain immunity to
paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning, and you gain
tremorsense 30 feet even when not rooted.


## Wizard

Bending reality to their will through careful study, wizards are the
embodiment of the phrase “mind over matter,” changing whole worlds with
nothing but their keen intellects and ancient lore. In their quest to
unravel and repurpose the fundamental laws of existence, many wizards
come to appreciate the benefits of narrowly focusing their study.
Presented below are several new schools of magic to help you customize
your wizard's arcane pursuits.

### Elemental Arcane Schools

Instead of specializing in one of the standard eight schools of magic, a
wizard can choose to specialize in one of the four elemental schools of
magic. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number
of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can
cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a
spell from the elemental school's spell list (see Chapter 5). Unlike a
normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to
select his opposed element as his opposition school (air opposes earth,
fire opposes water). He does not need to select a second opposition
school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his
opposed elemental school as normal.

#### Air School

The air elementalist uses the forces of the wind, sky, clouds, and
lightning to confuse and destroy his foes, all while flying through the
air with ease.

*Air Supremacy (Su)*: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on
[Fly] skill checks. This bonus increases by
+1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can cast
*[Feather Fall]* on
yourself at will. At 5th level, you can cast
*[Levitate]* on yourself at will.
At 10th level, you can cast *[Fly]*on yourself at
will. At 20th level, whenever you make a
[Fly] skill check, assume the roll resulted
in a natural 20.

*Lightning Flash (Su)*: As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of
electricity. This flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point
for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet
of you and dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates
the dazzled effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal
to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
modifier.

*Cyclone (Su)*: At 8th level, you can create a vortex of turbulent wind
around yourself as a standard action. This vortex has a radius of up to
10 feet and a maximum height of 10 feet per wizard level you possess.
Any ranged attack passing through this vortex automatically misses. Any
flying creature moving through the vortex must make a
[Fly] skill check or immediately fall from
the sky, taking falling damage (the creature cannot make a
[Fly] check to reduce or negate this
damage). Creatures on the ground cannot pass through the vortex without
first making a Strength check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 +
your caster level. The vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with
a DC 15 [Perception] skill
check. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to
your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

#### Earth School

The earth elementalist draws power from the stone around him, shaping
it, shattering it, and bending it to his will. He can use it to defend
himself or cause it to rise up and crush his foes.

*Earth Supremacy (Su)*: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your CMD to
resist bull rush, reposition, trip, and overrun attempts as long as you
are touching the ground. This bonus increases by +1 for every five
wizard levels you possess. In addition, you gain a +1 insight bonus on
melee attack and damage rolls whenever both you and your foe are
touching the ground. At 20th level, earth and stone do not block the
line of effect of your spells, although they do still block your line of
sight.

*Acid Cloud (Su)*: As a standard action, you can create a 5-foot-radius
cloud of acid vapor within 30 feet that lasts for 1 round. This cloud
deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels
you possess to all creatures in the cloud and sickens them for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect and halves the
damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level +
your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that begin their turn inside the
cloud can move out that turn without penalty, but those that enter the
cloud are affected. You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Earth Glide (Su)*: At 8th level, you gain the ability to move through
earth, dirt, and stone for a number of rounds per day equal to your
wizard level. You cannot move through worked earth or stone; only
natural substances can be traversed. If your total duration expires
before you exit the earth, you are flung back to the point where you
entered the stone, take 4d6 points of damage, and are stunned for 1
round. Your burrowing does not leave a hole, nor does it give any sign
of your presence (although you can be detected by creatures with
tremorsense). These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

#### Fire School

The fire elementalist sees a world around him that is made to burn, and
he can bring that fire to consume his foes. He has also learned that
fire can purify and protect, if properly controlled.

*Fire Supremacy (Su)*: You gain resistance 5 to fire. At 10th level,
this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, you gain immunity to
fire damage. In addition, whenever you are within 5 feet of a source of
flame at least as large as a campfire, you can draw the fire around you
for 1 round as a swift action. Anyone striking you with a melee weapon
or unarmed strike takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your
wizard level (minimum 1). Weapons with reach avoid this damage.

*Fire Jet (Su)*: As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line
of fire. Anyone in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point
for every two wizard levels you possess. A successful Reflex save halves
this damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level
+ your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their saving throw
catch fire and take 1d6 points of fire damage on the following round.
Creatures that catch fire can avoid this damage by taking a full-round
action to extinguish the flames by making a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling
on the ground gives a +2 circumstance bonus on the save. Dousing the
creature with water automatically extinguishes the flame. You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
modifier.

*Dancing Flame (Su)*: At 8th level, as a standard action, you can sculpt
fire to suit your desires. With one use of this ability you can move any
nonmagical fire up to 30 feet. Alternatively you can use this ability to
alter any fire spell that you cast with a duration of instantaneous by
removing any number of squares from its area of affect. If the fire
spell has a duration, you can use this ability to reposition the spell,
within its original range (treat this as if you had just cast the spell,
even though the duration is unchanged). You cannot use this ability on a
fire spell that you did not cast. If you move a nonmagical flame, it
must have a new source of fuel. If it does not, it is extinguished in
one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to
1/2 your wizard level.

#### Water School

The water elementalist draws magic from the ocean depths. His power is
fluid as well, crushing foes in mighty waves or wearing them down
through timeless erosion.

*Water Supremacy (Su)*: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on
[Swim] skill checks. This bonus increases
by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can
hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your
Constitution score before you must start making checks to avoid
drowning. At 10th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed.
At 20th level, whenever you make a [Swim]
skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

*Cold Blast (Su)*: As a standard action, you can unleash a blast of
freezing cold. This blast deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for
every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of
you and staggers them for 1 round. A successful Reflex save negates the
staggered effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to
10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
modifier.

*Wave (Su)*: At 8th level, you can create a wave of water that starts at
your location and moves 30 feet per round away from you in a direction
of your choosing. Creatures struck by the wave might be knocked down and
pushed away. Make a caster level check against the CMD of each creature
struck. If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone. If your check
exceeds the CMD of the creature by 5 or more, it is carried with the
wave during the wave's movement this round. You receive a +5 bonus on
this check if the creature shares its space with the wave at the start
of your turn (when the wave moves). Creatures carried in this way can
move out of the wave on their turn if they succeed on a Strength check
(DC = 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier), but they
cannot breathe while sharing space with the wave. The wave is up to 20
feet high and up to 5 feet long for each wizard level you possess.
Nonmagical fires hit by the wave are automatically extinguished. Magical
fire effects are unaffected. You can use this ability for a number of
rounds per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

### Focused Arcane Schools

Wizards that specialize in one of the schools of magic can instead chose
to focus their studies still further. Wizards who choose a focused
arcane school retain the bonus spells from their school and must select
two prohibited schools as normal, but the focused school changes one or
more of the powers granted by their arcane school. A wizard must take
all of the replacement powers associated with his focused arcane school.
Once a focused arcane school is chosen, it cannot be changed.

#### Admixture School

**Associated School**: Evocation.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the force
missile and elemental wall powers of the evocation school.

**Versatile Evocation (Su)**: When you cast an evocation spell that does
acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you may change the damage dealt
to one of the other four energy types. This changes the descriptor of
the spell to match the new energy type. Any non-damaging effects remain
unchanged unless the new energy type invalidates them (an *[Ice Storm]*
that deals fire damage might still provide a penalty on
[Perception] checks due to
smoke, but it would not create difficult terrain). Such effects are
subject to GM discretion. You can use this ability a number of times per
day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Elemental Manipulation (Su)**: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot
aura that transforms magical energy. Choose an energy type from acid,
cold, electricity, and fire, and a second type to transform it into. Any
magical source of energy of this type with a caster level equal to or
less than your wizard level is altered to the chosen energy type. This
includes supernatural effects from creatures with Hit Dice no greater
than your caster level. For example, you could transform a white
dragon's frigid breath weapon (a supernatural ability), but not a fire
elemental's fiery touch (an extraordinary ability). If an effect lies
only partially within your aura, only the portions within the aura are
transformed. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day
equal to your wizard level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive.

#### Banishment School

**Associated School**: Abjuration.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the energy
absorption power and the protective ward power of the abjuration school.

**Unstable Bonds (Su)**: At 1st level, your touch can disrupt the bonds
that hold a summoned or called creature on this plane. As a melee touch
attack, you can cause a summoned or called creature to become shaken and
staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum
1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Intelligence modifier.

**Aura of Banishment (Su)**: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura
of banishment for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level.
Any summoned or called creature in the area must make a Will save each
round. Once the creature fails a Will saving throw, it is staggered as
long as it remains inside the aura. If it fails a second Will saving
throw, it is immediately sent back to its home plane and the spell that
summoned it immediately ends. If that spell summoned more than one
creature, only the creature that failed its saving throws is affected.
These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

#### Controller School

**Associated School**: Enchantment.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the
enchanting smile and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

**Force of Will (Su)**: You can send thoughts and instructions
telepathically to any creature within 60 feet that you have charmed or
dominated as though you shared a common language. At 11th level,
affected creatures can communicate back to you via the telepathic link
as well. At 20th level, any creature that succeeds at a saving throw
against an enchantment spell you have just cast is still affected for 1
round if the spell has a duration greater than 1 round.

**Irresistible Demand (Sp)**: At 8th level, you can force others to do
your bidding. As a standard action, you attempt to dominate a creature
as though using the *[Dominate Monster]* spell,
except that the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less
than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving
throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your
wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can dominate creatures
for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds
do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action
to maintain control over a dominated creature.

#### Counterspell School

**Associated School**: Abjuration.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the
protective ward power and the energy absorption power of the abjuration
school.

**Disruption (Su)**: At 1st level, you gain the ability to disrupt
spellcasting with a touch. As a melee touch attack, you can place a
disruptive field around the target. While the field is in place, the
target must make a concentration check to cast any spell or to use a
spell-like ability in addition to any other required concentration
checks. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell's level.
If the check is failed, the target's spell is wasted. This field lasts
for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You
can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Intelligence modifier.

**Counterspell Mastery (Su)**: At 6th level, you gain [Improved Counterspell] as a bonus feat.
You may attempt to counterspell an opponent's spell once per day as an
immediate action (instead of a readied action). You must use a spell at
least one level higher than the spell being countered to use this
ability. You can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one
additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th.

#### Creation School

**Associated School**: Conjuration.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the acid
dart power and the dimensional steps power of the conjuration school.

**Create Gear (Su)**: At 1st level, you can create any object that
weighs no more than 1 pound per wizard level you possess. Creating an
object in this way is a standard action. The item remains for 1 minute
before fading away, although it disappears after one round if it leaves
your possession. Creating an item to an exact specification might
require a [Craft] skill check, subject
to GM discretion. The object must be made of simple materials, such as
wood, stone, glass, or metal, and cannot contain any moving parts. You
could use this ability to create a dagger, but not a vial of alchemist's
fire. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
your Intelligence modifier.

**Creator's Will (Sp)**: At 8th level, you can cast *[Minor Creation]* as a
spell-like ability. You can have no more than one *[Minor Creation]* active at a
time. If you cast the spell again, the previous casting immediately
ends. At 12th level, this ability improves to *[Major Creation]*. You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

#### Enhancement School

**Associated School**: Transmutation.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the
telekinetic fist and change shape powers of the transmutation school.

**Augment (Sp)**: As a standard action, you can touch a creature and
grant it either a +2 enhancement bonus to a single ability score of your
choice or a +1 bonus to natural armor that stacks with any natural armor
the creature might possess. At 10th level, the enhancement bonus to one
ability score increases to +4. The natural armor bonus increases by +1
for every five wizard levels you possess, to a maximum of +5 at 20th
level. This augmentation lasts a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
wizard level (minimum 1 round). You can use this ability a number of
times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Perfection of Self (Su)**: At 8th level, as a swift action you can
grant yourself an enhancement bonus to a single ability score equal to
1/2 your wizard level (maximum +10) for one round. You may use this
ability for a number of times per day equal to your wizard level.

#### Foresight School

**Associated School**: Divination.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the
diviner's fortune and scrying adept powers of the divination school.

**Prescience (Su)**: At the beginning of your turn, you may, as a free
action, roll a single d20. At any point before your next turn, you may
use the result of this roll as the result of any d20 roll you are
required to make. If you do not use the d20 result before your next
turn, it is lost. You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Foretell (Su)**: At 8th level, you can utter a prediction of the
immediate future. While your foretelling is in effect, you emit a
30-foot aura of fortune that aids your allies or hinders your enemies,
as chosen by you at the time of prediction. If you choose to aid, you
and your allies gain a +2 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls,
caster level checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you choose to
hinder, your enemies take a -2 penalty on those rolls instead. You can
use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard
level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

#### Generation School

**Associated School**: Evocation.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the intense
spells and force missile powers of the evocation school.

**Lingering Evocations (Su)**: Any evocation spell you cast with a
duration greater than instantaneous lasts an additional number of rounds
equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1). At 20th level, any dispel
checks made against your evocation spells must be rolled twice, and your
opponent must use the less favorable result.

**Wind Servant (Sp)**: As a standard action, you can generate a blast of
air that hurls an unattended object (or objects) or an object in your
possession up to 30 feet in a straight line. If you have a free hand,
you can catch an object hurled toward yourself. You can move objects
weighing up to 1 pound per wizard level. Objects are not thrown with
enough force to cause damage, although fragile objects like alchemical
weapons shatter on contact with a creature or hard surface. To hit a
creature with an object, you must succeed at a ranged touch attack. You
can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Intelligence modifier.

#### Life School

**Associated School**: Necromancy.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the power
over undead and grave touch powers of the necromancy school.

**Healing Grace (Su)**: Whenever you cast a spell that has targets,
affects creatures in an area, or requires an attack roll, you may heal
creatures affected by the spell a total of 1 point of damage per level
of the spell. This healing may be spread out between the targets of the
spell in any way you choose. If you assign any of the healing to an
undead creature, it instead takes 1 point of damage for each point
assigned. At 11th level, the amount of damage cured increases to 2
points of damage per level of the spell. This healing occurs when the
spell is cast and has no effect on creatures that enter its area after
the spell is in place. At 20th level, the amount of damage cured
increases to 3 points of damage per level of the spell.

**Share Essence (Sp)**: As a standard action, you can share your vital
energy with a living creature that you touch. You take 1d6 points of
nonlethal damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You cannot
take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to or greater than your current
hit point total; any excess is prevented. The recipient gains a number
of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you received
(prevented damage is not counted). These temporary hit points disappear
1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant yourself temporary
hit points. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to
3 + your Intelligence modifier. This ability has no effect if you are
immune to nonlethal damage.

#### Manipulator School

**Associated School**: Enchantment.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the dazing
touch and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

**Beguiling Touch (Sp)**: You can charm a living creature by touching
it. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected,
as are creatures in combat and those with an attitude of hostile toward
you. Creatures receive a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The DC
of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence
modifier. Creatures that fail their save are affected by *[Charm Monster]* for a number of
rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This is a
mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per
day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Shape Emotions (Su)**: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura to
either ward off or welcome emotional influence for a number of rounds
per day equal to your wizard level. If you choose to ward, you and your
allies within this aura receive a +4 morale bonus on saves against
mind-affecting spells and effects, and any fear effects targeting you or
your allies are reduced by one step (shaken has no effect, frightened
becomes shaken, and panicked becomes frightened). If you chose to
enhance emotional influence, enemies within the aura receive a -2
penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. These rounds
do not need to be consecutive.

#### Phantasm School

**Associated School**: Illusion.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the blinding
ray and invisibility field powers of the illusion school.

**Terror (Su)**: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack
that causes a creature to be assailed by nightmares only it can see. The
creature provokes an attack of opportunity from you or an ally of your
choice. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are
unaffected. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
modifier.

**Bedeviling Aura (Su)**: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that
bedevils your enemies with phantasmal assailants. Enemies within this
aura move at half speed, are unable to take attacks of opportunity, and
are considered to be flanked. This is a mind-affecting effect. You can
use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard
level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

#### Scryer School

**Associated School**: Divination.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the diviner's
fortune power of the divination school.

**Send Senses (Sp)**: As a standard action, you place a scrying sensor
at a point within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/wizard level) that
you can see and have line of effect to. You can see or hear (not both)
through this sensor for number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level
(minimum 1). The sensor otherwise functions as a
*clairaudience/clairovoyance* spell with a caster level equal to your
wizard level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

#### Shadow School

**Associated School**: Illusion.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the blinding
ray and invisibility field powers of the illusion school.

**Binding Darkness (Sp)**: As a standard action, you cast a weave of
shadows at any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The shadows
entangle your foe for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every five
wizard levels you possess. In conditions of bright light, this duration
is halved (minimum 1 round). A creature entangled by your shadows has
concealment from those without darkvision or the ability to see in
darkness, and other creatures likewise have concealment relative to it.
You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Intelligence modifier.

**Shadow Step (Sp)**: At 8th level, you can use this ability to walk
through the Shadow Plane and reappear as a standard action. You can
travel up to 30 feet per wizard level per day in this fashion, either in
a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement
must be used in 5-foot increments and does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when you
arrive, you re-enter 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown
[Splash Weapons]. If this would
place you in an occupied square, you instead arrive in the nearest safe
location. When you arrive, you are cloaked in shadow and gain
concealment as the *[Blur]* spell for 1
round. You may bring other willing creatures with you, but you must
expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought
with you. They likewise re-enter off target (roll location for each
creature) and are cloaked in shadow for 1 round.

bonus on attack and damage rolls for every four wizard levels you
possess. You can grow a claw, a bite, or a gore attack. These attacks
deal the normal damage for a creature of your size. At 11th level, you
can shape two natural weapons. You may not grow additional limbs or a
tail with this ability. You can use this ability a number of times per
day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Shift (Su)**: At 1st level, you can teleport to a nearby space as a
swift action as if using *[Dimension Door]*. This movement
does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must be able to see the
space that you are moving into. You cannot take other creatures with you
when you use this ability (except for familiars). You can move 5 feet
for every two wizard levels you possess (minimum 5 feet). You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
modifier.

#### Undead School

**Associated School**: Necromancy.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the grave

attack rolls and saving throws, as well as 1 temporary hit point per Hit
Die and a +2 bonus to its turn resistance. The bonus on attack rolls and
saving throws increases by +1 for every 5 wizard levels you possess.
These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level
(minimum 1 round). The bonuses and temporary hit points are immediately
dispelled if the creature is within the area of a
*[Consecrate]* spell. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Intelligence modifier.
