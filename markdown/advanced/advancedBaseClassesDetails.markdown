# Alchemist


Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully
experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is
often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous
as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of alchemical items
content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing
tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper
calling. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist
captures his own magic potential within liquids and extracts he creates,
infusing his chemicals with virulent power to grant him impressive skill
with poisons, explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.

**Role**: The alchemist's reputation is not softened by his exuberance
(some would say dangerous recklessness) in perfecting his magical
extracts and potion-like creations, infusing these substances with magic
siphoned from his aura and using his own body as experimental stock. Nor
is it mollified by the alchemist's almost gleeful passion for building
explosive bombs and discovering strange new poisons and methods for
their use. These traits, while making him a liability and risk for most
civilized organizations and institutions of higher learning, seem to fit
quite well with most adventuring groups.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

# Class Features


The following are class features of the alchemist.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Alchemists are proficient with all
simple weapons and bombs. They are also proficient with light armor, but
not with shields.

**Alchemy (Su)**: Alchemists are not only masters of creating mundane
alchemical substances such as alchemist's fire and smokesticks, but also
of fashioning magical potion-like extracts in which they can store spell
effects. In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing
ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by
drinking the extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he
infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical
power-this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the
effects to the creator.

When using [Craft](#craft) (alchemy) to create
an alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his
class level on the [Craft](#craft) (alchemy)
check. In addition, an alchemist can use
[Craft](#craft) (alchemy) to identify potions as
if using *[detect magic](#detect-magic)*.
He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.

An alchemist can create three special types of magical items-extracts,
bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens
are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his
physical abilities-both of these are detailed in their own sections
below.

Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they behave
like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled
by effects like *[dispel
magic](#dispel-magic)*using the
alchemist's level as the caster level. Unlike potions, though, extracts
can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a potion normally
could not.

An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level
per day. His base daily allotment of extracts is given on Table 2–1. In
addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high
Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per
day.

When an alchemist mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and
reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura.
An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist's
possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping-an
alchemist cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use (but
see the “infusion” discovery below). An extract, once created, remains
potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an alchemist must
re-prepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of
work-most alchemists prepare many extracts at the start of the day or
just before going on an adventure, but it's not uncommon for an
alchemist to keep some (or even all) of his daily extract slots open so
that he can prepare extracts in the field as needed.

Although the alchemist doesn't actually cast spells, he does have a
formulae list that determines what extracts he can create. An alchemist
can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formuale
list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses [Use Magic
Device](#use-magic-device) to do so).
An extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a potion-the effects
of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is
based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist.
An alchemist can draw and drink an extract as a standard action. The
alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect
based on caster level.

Creating extracts consumes raw materials, but the cost of these
materials is insignificant-comparable to the valueless material
components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material
component, that component is expended during the consumption of that
particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus
requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate divine spells never have
a divine focus requirement).

An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or
use an extract, an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at
least 10 + the extract's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against an alchemist's extract is 10 + the extract level + the
alchemist's Intelligence modifier.

An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in
a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book
whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An
alchemist begins play with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a
number of additional forumlae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At
each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he
can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a
wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and
time requirements. An alchemist can study a wizard's spellbook to learn
any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A
wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist
does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them.

**Bomb (Su)**: In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at
swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their
magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their
enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his
class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not
used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert-their
method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from
being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must
use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst-the alchemist
can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an
alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same
manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a
number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total
number of bombs they can create in that day-once created, a catalyst
vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.

Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a
standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs
have a range of 20 feet and use the [Throw Splash
Weapon](#throw-splash-weapon) special attack. Bombs
are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as
[Point-Blank Shot](#point-blank-shot) and [Weapon
Focus](#weapon-focus). On a direct hit, an alchemist's
bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the
alchemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist's bomb
increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this
bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such
as [Vital Strike](#vital-strike)). Splash damage from
an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if
the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its
splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the
splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this
save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's
Intelligence modifier.

Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the
Discovery ability) as they level up. An alchemist's bomb, like an
extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.

**[Brew Potion](#brew-potion) (Ex)**: At 1st level,
alchemists receive [Brew Potion](#brew-potion) as a
bonus feat. An alchemist can brew potions of any formulae he knows (up
to 3rd level), using his alchemist level as his caster level. The spell
must be one that can be made into a potion. The alchemist does not need
to meet the prerequisites for this feat.

**Mutagen (Su)**: At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a
mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at
the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen,
and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only
maintain one dose of mutagen at a time-if he brews a second dose, any
existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen
that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert until an
alchemist picks it up again.

When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability
score-either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard
action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the
alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural
armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for
10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in
effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability
scores. If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to
his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to
his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his
Charisma.

A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +
1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier) or
become nauseated for 1 hour-a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit
of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another
alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist
creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen
immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an
alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen
immediately end.

**[Throw Anything](#throw-anything) (Ex)**: All
alchemists gain the [Throw Anything](#throw-anything)
feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. An alchemist adds his Intelligence
modifier to damage done with splash weapons, including the splash damage
if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.

**Discovery (Su)**: At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels
thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible
alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select
an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be
made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as
uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are
marked with an asterisk (\*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can
be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for
by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the
alchemist's Intelligence modifier.

*Acid bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have
it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid
bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.

*Combine extracts*: When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place
two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both
formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than
the highest-level formulae placed in the extract. An alchemist must be
at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.

*Concentrate poison*: The alchemist can combine two doses of the same
poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison
and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one
dose of poison. The poison's frequency is extended by 50% and the save
DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its
creation or it is ruined.

*Concussive bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to
have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic
damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level,
instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb
are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. An
alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.

*Delayed bomb*: The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a
number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This
delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a
number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist
reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and
prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if
any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's
contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The
bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the
square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all
adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one
delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the
previous bomb becomes inert. *[Dispel
magic](#dispel-magic)* can neutralize a
delayed bomb, as can a successful [Disable
Device](#disable-device) check (DC
equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence
modifier). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
discovery.

*Dilution*: Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or
elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a
potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion's market
value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again. This
discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens. An alchemist
must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.

*Dispelling Bomb*: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to
have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take
a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted *[dispel
magic](#dispel-magic)* spell, using the
alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a
specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before
selecting this discovery.

*Elixir of life*: Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of
life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour
of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who
brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell *[true
resurrection](#true-resurrection)*.
Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after
which point he is immediately targeted with a
*[resurrection](#resurrection)* spell the
next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of
life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's
Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the
effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th
level before selecting this discovery.

*Enhance potion*: A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence
modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a
caster level equal to his class level.

*Eternal potion*: If an alchemist drinks a potion that he extends, the
effects of that potion become permanent until he chooses to make another
potion effect permanent. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and
must possess the extend potion discovery before selecting this
discovery.

*Explosive bomb\**: The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10
feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an
explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round
until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round
action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the
target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons
of water automatically extinguishes the flames.

*Extend potion*: A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence
modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not
have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration.
This does not apply to extracts.

*Fast bombs*: An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough
bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can
prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base
attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This
functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon. An alchemist
must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.

*Feral mutagen*: Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two
claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made
using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6
points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack
deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the
mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on
[Intimidate](#intimidate) skill checks.

*Force bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have
it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage,
plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of
1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked
prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save. An alchemist must be at
least 8th level before selecting this discovery.

*Frost bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have
it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost
bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude
save.

*Grand mutagen*: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +6 natural armor
bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability
score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The
alchemist takes a –2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
as long as the mutagen persists (see Mutagen). An alchemist must be at
least 16th level and must possess the greater mutagen discovery before
selecting this discovery.

*Greater mutagen*: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor
bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength,
Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second
physical ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty on both
associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists. An
alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.

*Infuse mutagen*: When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it
with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of
Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare
reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not
rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an
alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for
emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of
multiple mutagens-only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.

*Inferno bomb\**: The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's
bomb duplicate the effects of *[incendiary
cloud](#incendiary-cloud)* instead of
*[fog cloud](),*filling an area equal to twice
the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at
least 16th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before
selecting this discovery.

*Infusion*: When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with
an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists
even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it
continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An
infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.

*Madness bomb*: The alchemist's bombs do more than sear flesh-they sear
the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes
damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount
of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally
deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The
amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each
madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1
point of Wisdom damage. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before
selecting this discovery.

*Poison bomb\**: The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb
duplicates the effects of
*[cloudkill](#cloudkill)* instead of *[fog
cloud]()*, filling an area equal to twice the
bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at
least 12th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before
selecting this discovery.

*Precise bombs*: Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a
number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not
affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this
discovery has no effect.

*Shock bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have
it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a
shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.

*Smoke bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have
it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions
as *[fog cloud]()*, filling an area equal to
twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.

*Sticky bomb*: The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and
continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage.
Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash
damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur
1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later. An
alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.

*Sticky poison*: Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky-when the
alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a
number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. An
alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.

*Stink bomb\**: The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb
can duplicate the effects of *[stinking
cloud](#stinking-cloud)* instead of
*[fog cloud]()*, filling an area equal to
twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess
the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.

**Poison Resistance (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2 bonus
on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th
level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, an alchemist
becomes completely immune to poison.

**Poison Use (Ex)**: Alchemists are trained in the use of poison and
starting at 2nd level, cannot accidentally poison themselves when
applying poison to a weapon.

**Swift Alchemy (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an alchemist can create alchemical
items with astounding speed. It takes an alchemist half the normal
amount of time to create alchemical items, and he can apply poison to a
weapon as a move action.

**Swift Poisoning (Ex)**: At 6th level, an alchemist can apply a dose of
poison to a weapon as a swift action.

**Persistent Mutagen (Su)**: At 14th level, the effects of a mutagen
last for 1 hour per level.

**Instant Alchemy (Ex)**: At 18th level, an alchemist can create
alchemical items with almost supernatural speed. He can create any
alchemical item as a full-round action if he succeeds at the
[Craft](#craft) (alchemy) check and has the
appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation. He can apply poison
to a weapon as an immediate action.

**Grand Discovery (Su)**: At 20th level, the alchemist makes a grand
discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns
a third discovery chosen from the list below, representing a truly
astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many
alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary
goal of their experiments and hard work.

*Awakened Intellect*: The alchemist's constant exposure to strange
chemicals has expanded his mind. His Intelligence score permanently
increases by 2 points.

*Eternal Youth*: The alchemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from
this point forward he takes no penalty to his physical ability scores
from advanced age. If the alchemist is already taking such penalties,
they are removed at this time.

*Fast Healing*: The alchemist's flesh responds to damage with shocking
speed-he gains fast healing 5.

*Philosopher's Stone*: The alchemist learns how to create a
[*philosopher's
stone*](#philosopher-s-stone), and can
do so once per month at no cost. Creating a *philosopher's stone* takes
1 day of work.

*Poison Touch*: The alchemist gains a poisonous touch, as if under the
effects of a *[poison](#poison)* spell. He can
suppress or activate this ability as a free action. The physical
appearance of how the alchemist generates and delivers his poisonous
touch varies from alchemist to alchemist.

*True Mutagen*: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +8 natural armor
bonus and a +8 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty to his Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists (see Mutagen). An
alchemist must possess the grand mutagen discovery before selecting this
discovery.

Cavalier

Cavalier
========

While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their
time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort
dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers,
swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are
skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across
a battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long,
fluttering banner. The cavalier's true power comes from the conviction
of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.

**Role**: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using
their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight.
Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through
diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is no stranger to
courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of
social situations.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Dice**: d10.

Class Skills
============

The cavalier's class skills are [Bluff](#bluff)

[Craft](#craft) (Int),
[Diplomacy](#diplomacy) (Cha), [Handle

  : Table: Cavalier

Class Features
==============

The following are the class features of the cavalier.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Cavaliers are proficient with all
simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, light, and
medium) and with shields (except tower shields).

**Challenge (Ex)**: Once per day, a cavalier can challenge a foe to
combat. As a swift action, the cavalier chooses one target within sight
to challenge. The cavalier's melee attacks deal extra damage whenever
the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra
damage is equal to the cavalier's level. The cavalier can use this
ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for
every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at
19th level.

Challenging a foe requires much of the cavalier's concentration. The
cavalier takes a –2 penalty to his Armor Class, except against attacks
made by the target of his challenge.

The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious
or until the combat ends. Each cavalier's challenge also includes
another effect which is listed in the section describing the cavalier's
order.

**Mount (Ex)**: A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed
to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid's animal
companion, using the cavalier's level as his effective druid level. The
creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a
mount. A Medium cavalier can select a camel or a horse. A Small cavalier
can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he is
at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable
mounts.

A cavalier does not take an armor check penalty on
[Ride](#ride) checks while riding his mount. The
mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light
Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A cavalier's mount does not gain the
share spells special ability.

A cavalier's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to
anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a cavalier's mount die,
the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of
mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or
improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier
gains a level.

**Order (Ex)**: At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a
specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class
skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number
of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these
edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24
hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process
to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he
immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then
follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining
any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the
bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might
vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

**Tactician (Ex)**: At 1st level, a cavalier receives a teamwork feat as
a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a
standard action, the cavalier can grant this feat to all allies within
30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus
feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two levels the cavalier
possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus
feats. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus
one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels
thereafter.

**Cavalier's Charge (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more
accurate charge attacks while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus
on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal
+2). In addition, the cavalier does not suffer any penalty to his AC
after making a charge attack while mounted.

**Expert Trainer (Ex)**: At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train mounts
with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier receives a bonus
equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses [Handle
Animal](#handle-animal) on an animal that
serves as a mount. In addition, he can reduce the time needed to teach a
mount a new trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1
week required by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than
one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the
DC.

**Banner (Ex)**: At 5th level, a cavalier's banner becomes a symbol of
inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier's
banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale
bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack
rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels
thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least
Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his
mount to function.

**Bonus Feat**: At 6th level, and at every six levels thereafter, a
cavalier gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal
advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as
combat feats. The cavalier must meet the prerequisites of these bonus
feats.

**Greater Tactician (Ex)**: At 9th level, the cavalier receives an
additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites
for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the
tactician ability. Using the tactician ability is a swift action.

**Mighty Charge (Ex)**: At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make
devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range of any
weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This increase does not
stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon.
In addition, the cavalier can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or
trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free
combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Demanding Challenge (Ex)**: At 12th level, whenever a cavalier
declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he
poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the
cavalier, it takes a –2 penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone
other than the cavalier.

**Greater Banner (Ex)**: At 14th level, the cavalier's banner becomes a
rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2
morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and
effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can
spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all
allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell
or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC.
Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by
this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once
per day.

**Master Tactician (Ex)**: At 17th level, the cavalier receives an
additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites
for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the
tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier uses the tactician ability, he
grants any two teamwork feats that he knows. He can select from any of
his teamwork feats, not just his bonus feats.

**Supreme Charge (Ex)**: At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a
charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage
(or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a
critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for
1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC
is equal to 10 + the cavalier's base attack bonus.

Cavalier Orders
===============

The following orders represent the most common chosen by cavaliers.
Members of these orders are not necessarily bound together, but some
organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong
to one specific order.

Order of the Cockatrice
-----------------------

A cavalier who belongs to this order serves only himself, working to
further his own aims and increase his own prestige. Cavaliers of this
order tend to be selfish and concerned only with personal goals and
objectives.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must keep his own interests and aims above
those of all others. He must always accept payment when it is due,
rewards when earned, and an even (or greater) share of loot. The
cavalier must take every opportunity to increase his own stature,
prestige, and power.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the cockatrice cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all melee damage rolls made
against the target of his challenge as long as he is the only creature
threatening the target (not counting his mount). This bonus increases by
+1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the cockatrice cavalier adds
[Appraise](#appraise) (Int) and
[Perform](#perform) (Cha) to his list of class
skills. In addition, an order of the cockatrice cavalier adds his
Charisma modifier to the DC on another creature's attempt to demoralize
him through [Intimidate](#intimidate) (in
addition to his Wisdom modifier, as normal).

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier that belongs to the order of the
cockatrice gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

*Braggart (Ex)*: At 2nd level, the cavalier can spend a standard action
to extol his own accomplishments and battle prowess. He receives
[Dazzling Display](#dazzling-display) as a bonus feat.
He does not need a weapon in hand to use this ability. The cavalier
receives a +2 morale bonus on melee attack rolls made against
demoralized targets.

*Steal Glory (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier can steal the glory from
another creature's successful strike. Whenever a creature other than the
cavalier scores a critical hit against a target that the cavalier is
threatening, he can make an attack of opportunity against the same
target.

*Moment of Triumph (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can, as a free
action, declare a moment of triumph. For 1 round, the cavalier receives
a competence bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on all ability checks,
attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. This bonus
is also added to his AC. In addition, any critical threats he makes are
automatically confirmed. The cavalier can use this ability once per day.

Order of the Dragon
-------------------

Cavaliers belonging to the order of the dragon dedicate themselves to a
group of like-minded individuals, be it a mercenary company or a small
band of adventurers. These cavaliers believe in loyalty and friendship,
and are willing to lay down their lives to protect their allies.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must remain loyal to his allies and must always
work to further the aims of the group. He must protect his allies from
harm and defend their honor when called into doubt.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the dragon cavalier issues a
challenge, his allies receive a +1 circumstance bonus on melee attack
rolls against the target of his challenge whenever he is threatening the
target. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier
possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the dragon cavalier adds
[Perception](#perception) (Wis) and
[Survival](#survival) (Wis) to his list of
class skills. In addition, whenever an order of the dragon cavalier uses
[Survival](#survival) to provide food and
water for his allies or to protect his allies from harsh weather, he
receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum
+1).

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier that belongs to the order of the dragon
gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

*Aid Allies (Ex)*: At 2nd level, whenever an order of the dragon
cavalier uses the aid another action to assist one of his allies, the
ally receives a +3 bonus to his Armor Class, attack roll, saving throw,
or skill check. At 8th level, and every six levels thereafter, this
bonus increases by an additional +1.

*Strategy (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier can spend a standard action
to grant one of a number of bonuses to all allies within 30 feet
(including himself). The allies must be able to see or hear the cavalier
to receive this bonus. The cavalier can grant a +2 dodge bonus to AC for
1 round, a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls for 1 round, or the
ability to move up to their speed as an immediate action once. The
cavalier can grant a different bonus to each ally within range, but
allies can only benefit from this ability once per combat.

*Act as One (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can spend a standard
action to move up to his speed and make a melee attack. All allies
within 30 feet can also move up to their speed and make a melee attack
as an immediate action. This movement and attack can be made as a charge
if the movement qualifies. All attacks are made at a +2 bonus (this
stacks with the bonus from a charge) and all participants receive a +2
dodge bonus to their AC for 1 round. A cavalier can use this ability
once per combat.

Order of the Lion
-----------------

A cavalier who belongs to this order has pledged himself to a sovereign;
be it a king, queen, or even the local warlord. Cavaliers of this order
are stalwart and dedicated to their cause, willing to go any length to
ensure the safety of their lord and his domain.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must protect the life and lands of his
sovereign at all costs. He must obey the commands of his sovereign
without question. He must strive to expand the power and prestige of his
realm.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the lion cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made
by the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by +1 for every
four levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the lion cavalier adds
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (local) (Int) and
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (nobility) (Int) to
his list of class skills. An order of the lion cavalier can make
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (nobility) skill
checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on
the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as the
check involves his sovereign.

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier belonging to the order of the lion gains
the following abilities as he increases in level.

*Lion's Call (Ex)*: At 2nd level, an order of the lion cavalier gains
the ability to rally his allies. As a standard action, he can give an
encouraging speech which grants all allies within 60 feet a competence
bonus on their saving throws against fear equal to his Charisma modifier
and a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls for a number of rounds equal
to his cavalier level. If an ally within range is under the effect of a
spell or ability that causes him to be frightened or panicked, he can
immediately make another saving throw to resist the effect (if allowed).

*For the King (Ex)*: At 8th level, an order of the lion cavalier can
call out to his allies, inspiring them to greatness. As a swift action,
the cavalier can grant a competence bonus equal to his Charisma modifier
on all attack and damage rolls to all allies within 30 feet. This bonus
lasts for 1 round. This ability can be used once per combat.

*Shield of the Liege (Ex)*: At 15th level, an order of the lion cavalier
can protect those around him. Allies that are adjacent to the cavalier
receive a +2 shield bonus to their AC. In addition, as an immediate
action, the cavalier can redirect an attack made at a creature adjacent
to himself, as long as the creature making the attack is within the
cavalier's reach. This ability must be declared before the attack roll
is made. The attack is made against the cavalier's AC and defenses, even
if the creature could not normally reach or attack the cavalier. The
cavalier loses any cover or concealment bonuses when subject to the
redirected attack.

Order of the Shield
-------------------

Cavaliers who join the order of the shield devote their lives to
protecting the common folk, from the simple farmer to the honest
craftsman. These cavaliers stand before the tide, protecting the
innocent from roving marauders and hungry monsters.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must protect the lives and prosperity of the
common folk, shielding them from the deprivations of those who would
seek to cause them harm or exploit them. He must give charity when it is
warranted and aid when needed. He must take no action that would cause
harm or hardship to those who cannot defend themselves.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the shield cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against
the target of his challenge if the target makes an attack against a
target other than the cavalier. This bonus lasts for 1 minute. The bonus
increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the shield cavalier adds
[Heal](#heal) (Wis) and
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (local) (Int) to his
list of class skills. Whenever an order of the shield cavalier uses the
[Heal](#heal) skill on a creature other than
himself, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier
level (minimum +1).

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier belonging to the order of the shield
gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

*Resolute (Ex)*: At 2nd level, whenever the cavalier takes damage from a
melee or ranged attack while wearing heavy armor, the cavalier can
convert 1 point of lethal damage to 1 point of nonlethal damage. He can
use this ability once each time he takes damage. This ability cannot be
used to convert ability damage, ability drain, or energy damage to
nonlethal damage. At 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, the
amount of damage the cavalier can convert increases by 1.

*Stem the Tide (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier receives [Stand
Still](#stand-still) as a bonus feat, even if he does
not meet the prerequisites. Instead of making a combat maneuver check to
stop the creature from moving, a cavalier with this ability can elect to
make a normal attack instead. If the attack hits and deals damage, the
target must stop moving, just as if the cavalier had made a successful
combat maneuver check.

*Protect the Meek (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can move to
intercept foes. As an immediate action, he can move up to his speed (or
his mount's speed, if mounted) and make a single melee attack. This
movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The cavalier must
end his movement adjacent to an enemy. On his next turn, the cavalier is
staggered and cannot use this ability again for 1 round.

Order of the Star
-----------------

Cavaliers who join the order of the star dedicate themselves to the
protection and service of a faith and its members. Cavaliers belonging
to this order tend to follow many of the tenets and guides of the
religion that they serve. When a cavalier joins this order, he should
select a single religion to serve.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must strive to protect the faith and all those
who follow its teachings, from priest to common man. He must adhere to
the strictures of the faith, promote its cause whenever possible, and
serve the agents of the divine.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the star cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all his saving throws as
long as he is threatening the target of his challenge. This bonus
increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the star cavalier adds
[Heal](#heal) (Wis) and
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (religion) (Int) to
his list of class skills. An order of the star cavalier can make
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (religion) skill
checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on
the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as the
check involves his chosen faith.

**Order Abilities**: An order of the star cavalier gains the following
abilities as he increases in level.

*Calling (Ex)*: At 2nd level, the cavalier can make a short prayer as a
standard action, filling him with confidence in his abilities. At any
point in the next minute, he can receive a competence bonus on an
ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check equal to his
Charisma modifier. He must declare that he is using this bonus before
the roll is made. He can use this ability up to four times per day, once
for each type of check or roll. In addition, the cavalier adds 1/2 his
cavalier level to any levels of paladin or cleric he might possess for
the purposes of determining the effects of channel energy or lay on
hands.

*For the Faith (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier can call upon his faith
to bolster himself in combat. As a free action, the cavalier can call
out the name of his deity, granting him a morale bonus on attack rolls
equal to his Charisma modifier for 1 round. In addition, any allies
within 30 feet that share his faith also receive half this bonus
(minimum +1). The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one
additional time per day at 12th level and every four levels thereafter.

*Retribution (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can take retribution on
those who dare to strike an agent of his faith. Whenever an enemy makes
a successful melee attack against the cavalier or an adjacent ally
devoted to the same faith as the cavalier, the enemy provokes an attack
of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier receives a +2 morale
bonus on the attack of opportunity. If the attack made by the enemy was
a critical hit, the cavalier may treat the enemy as the target of his
challenge for the attack of opportunity. The cavalier can use this
ability once per round.

Order of the Sword
------------------

Cavaliers who join the order of the sword dedicate their lives to the
code of chivalry, living a life of honor, valor, and fairness. Cavaliers
of this order tend to swear service to a lord or a lady. Of all the
orders, the order of the sword is perhaps the broadest in terms of its
focus and ideals.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must show courage in the face of danger, mercy
to those who have wronged him, and charity to the poor and the meek. He
must be just and honorable at all times and in all things. He must
defend his honor and, above all else, the honor of those he serves.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the sword cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the
target of his challenge so long as he is astride his mount. The bonus
increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the sword cavalier adds
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (nobility) (Int) and
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (religion) (Int) to
his list of class skills. Whenever the cavalier uses [Sense
Motive](#sense-motive) to oppose a
[Bluff](#bluff) check, he receives a competence
bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).

**Order Abilities**: An order of the sword cavalier receives the
following abilities as he increases in level.

*By My Honor (Ex)*: At 2nd level, the cavalier must select one
alignment. As long as he maintains the selected alignment, he receives a
+2 morale bonus to one saving throw of his choice.

*Mounted Mastery (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier ignores the armor
check penalty when using the [Ride](#ride) skill,
regardless of whether or not the creature he is riding is his mount.
Whenever he makes a charge attack while mounted, he receives a +4 dodge
bonus to his AC to avoid attacks set against his charge. When making
such an attack, he can add his mount's Strength modifier to the damage
roll, in addition to his own. He also receives a bonus feat, chosen from
the following list: [Mounted Combat](#mounted-combat),
[Ride-By Attack](#ride-by-attack), [Skill
Focus](#skill-focus)
([Ride](#ride)), [Spirited
Charge](#spirited-charge),
[Trample](#trample), or
[Unseat](#unseat). He must qualify for the feat
selected.

*Knight's Challenge (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can make a
knight's challenge once per day. This functions like a normal challenge,
but the cavalier adds his Charisma bonus on all attack rolls and damage
rolls made against the target of his challenge. In addition, he receives
a +4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits
against the target of his knight's challenge.

Inquisitor

Inquisitor
==========

Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith,
using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough.
Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of
the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their
deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take
extreme measures to meet their goals.

**Role**: Inquisitors tend to move from place to place, chasing down
enemies and researching emerging threats. As a result, they often travel
with others, if for no other reason than to mask their presence.
Inquisitors work with members of their faith whenever possible, but even
such allies are not above suspicion.

**Alignment**: An inquisitor's alignment must be within one step of her
deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.

**Hit Dice**: d8.

Class Skills
============

The inquisitor's class skills are
[Bluff](#bluff) (Cha),
[Climb](#climb) (Str),
[Craft](#craft) (Int),
[Diplomacy](#diplomacy) (Cha),
[Disguise](#disguise) (Cha),
[Heal](#heal) (Wis),
[Intimidate](#intimidate) (Cha),
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (arcana) (Int),
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (dungeoneering)
(Int), [Knowledge](#knowledge) (nature)

The following are class features of the inquisitor.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: An inquisitor is proficient with all
simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, longbow, repeating crossbow,
shortbow, and the favored weapon of her deity. She is also proficient
with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Spells**: An inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor
spell list. She can cast any spell she knows at any time without
preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her
allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

To learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a Wisdom score equal
to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving
throw against an inquisitor's spell is 10 + the spell level + the
inquisitor's Wisdom modifier.

An inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell
level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–3. In
addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom
score (see Table 1–3 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*).

An inquisitor's selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor
begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the
inquisitor's choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more
new spells as indicated on Table 2–4. (Unlike spells per day, the number
of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The
numbers on Table 2–4 are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter
(8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in
place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor “loses” the
old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the
same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one
level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast. The
inquisitor may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must
choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains
new spells known for the level.

**Domain**: Like a cleric's deity, an inquisitor's deity influences her
alignment, what magic she can perform, and her values. Although not as
tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, an inquisitor must still
hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go
against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor
can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can
select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain.
With the GM's approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead
of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination
and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.

Each domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of
the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for
each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses
her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and
effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of
her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an
inquisitor. Levels of cleric and inquisitor stack for the purpose of
determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus spells.

**Judgment (Su)**: Starting at 1st level, an inquisitor can pronounce
judgment upon her foes as a swift action. Starting when the judgment is
made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the
type of judgment made.

At 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th
level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this
ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts
until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately
end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these
bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned,
unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat,
the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can
participate in the combat again.

When the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of
judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to
another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses
instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select
profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.

*Destruction*: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1
sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for
every three inquisitor levels she possesses.

*Healing*: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast
healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each
round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The
amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels
she possesses.

*Justice*: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting
a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for
every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is
doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.

*Piercing*: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her
spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on
concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target's
spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor
levels she possesses.

*Protection*: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura,
granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1
for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this
bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits
against the inquisitor.

*Purity*: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes,
gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by
+1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the
bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.

*Resiliency*: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm,
granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she
possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment
(chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor's. If
she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.

*[Resistance](#resistance)*: The inquisitor
is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance
against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen
when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every
three inquisitor levels she possesses.

*Smiting*: This judgment bathes the inquisitor's weapons in a divine
light. The inquisitor's weapons count as magic for the purposes of
bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor's weapons also
count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the
purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one
of the inquisitor's alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does
not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor's weapons also
count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but
not for reducing hardness).

**Monster Lore (Ex)**: The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on
[Knowledge](#knowledge) skill checks in
addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to
identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.

**Orisons**: Inquisitors learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells,
as noted on Table 2–4 under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like
any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used
again. Orisons prepared using other spell slots, such as those due to
metamagic feats, are expended normally.

**Stern Gaze (Ex)**: Inquisitors are skilled at sensing deception and
intimidating their foes. An inquisitor receives a morale bonus on all
[Intimidate](#intimidate) and [Sense
Motive](#sense-motive) checks equal to 1/2
her inquisitor level (minimum +1).

**Cunning Initiative (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom
modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.

***Detect Alignment* (Sp)**: At will, an inquisitor can use *[detect
chaos](#detect-chaos)*, *[detect
evil](#detect-evil)*, *[detect
good](#detect-good)*, or *[detect
law](#detect-law)*. She can only use one of
these at any given time.

**Track (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds half her level on
[Survival](#survival) skill checks made to
follow or identify tracks.

**Solo Tactics (Ex)**: At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor's allies are
treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the inquisitor
for the purpose of determining whether the inquisitor receives a bonus
from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from
these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The
allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed
in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus.

**Teamwork Feat**: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, the
inquisitor gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal
advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as
teamwork feats. The inquisitor must meet the prerequisites of the
selected bonus feat.

As a standard action, the inquisitor can choose to learn a new bonus
teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has
already learned. In effect, the inquisitor loses the bonus feat in
exchange for the new one. She can only change the most recent teamwork
feat gained. Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, the previous
teamwork feat becomes set and cannot be changed again. An inquisitor can
change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to
her Wisdom modifier.

**Bane (Su)**: At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her weapons
with the *[bane](#weapons-bane)* weapon
special ability as a swift action. She must select one creature type
when she uses this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected
is humanoid or outsider). Once selected, the type can be changed as a
swift action. This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields
the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this
ability if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration expires.
This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the
inquisitor's level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

***Discern Lies* (Sp)**: At 5th level, an inquisitor can *[discern
lies](#discern-lies)*, as per the spell,
for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These
rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an
immediate action.

**Second Judgment (Ex)**: At 8th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her
judgment ability, she selects two different judgments, instead of one.
This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a swift action,
she can change one of these judgments to another type.

**Stalwart (Ex)**: At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental and
physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a Fortitude
or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a
successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability
can only be used if the inquisitor is wearing light armor, medium armor,
or no armor. A helpless inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the
stalwart ability.

**Greater Bane (Su)**: At 12th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her
bane ability, the amount of bonus damage dealt by the weapon against
creatures of the selected type increases to 4d6.

**Exploit Weakness (Ex)**: At 14th level, the inquisitor learns to take
advantage of any opportunity that presents itself. Whenever the
inquisitor scores a critical hit, she ignores any damage reduction the
target might have. In addition, if the target has regeneration, the
creature loses regeneration on the round following the critical hit and
can die normally during that round. Creatures whose regeneration always
functions are immune to this ability. Finally, if the inquisitor deals
energy damage to a creature with vulnerability to that energy type, she
deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.

**Third Judgment (Ex)**: At 16th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her
judgment ability, she selects three different judgments, instead of just
two. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a swift
action, the inquisitor can change one of these judgments to another
type.

**Slayer (Ex)**: At 17th level, an inquisitor learns to focus her
judgment. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she must
select one type of judgment. She is treated as if she were 5 levels
higher for the purposes of determining the bonus granted by the
judgment. Unlike other types of judgment, the one enhanced by this
ability cannot be changed for the remainder of the judgment

**True Judgment (Su)**: At 20th level, an inquisitor can call true
judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an inquisitor uses her
judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke true judgment on a foe as a
swift action. Once declared, the inquisitor can make a single melee (or
ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the
attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must make a
Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
inquisitor's level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier. Regardless of
whether or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the
inquisitor's true judgment ability for 24 hours. Once this ability has
been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: An inquisitor can't cast
spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has
one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the
chaotic, evil, good and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.

Ex-Inquisitors
==============

An inquisitor who slips into corruption or changes to a prohibited
alignment loses all spells and the judgment ability. She cannot
thereafter gain levels as an inquisitor until she atones (see the
*[atonement](#atonement)* spell
description).

Oracle

Oracle
======

Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more
mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power
without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even
they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic
through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many
sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead
of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods
that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a
gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in
unforeseen ways.

**Role**: Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or
temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small
group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and
revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it
through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Dice**: d8.

Class Skills
============

The oracle's class skills are [Craft](#craft)
(Int), [Diplomacy](#diplomacy) (Cha),
[Heal](#heal) (Wis),
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (history) (Int),
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (planes) (Int),
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (religion) (Int),
[Profession](#profession) (Wis), [Sense
Motive](#sense-motive) (Wis), and
[Spellcraft](#spellcraft) (Int). In
addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their
oracle mystery.

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

The following are the class features of the oracle.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Oracles are proficient with all simple
weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.

**Spells**: An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the [cleric spell
lists](#cleric-spells). She can cast any spell she
knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an
oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell
level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle's spell
is 10 + the spell's level + the oracle's Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of
spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is
given on Table 2–5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if
she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–3 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core
Rulebook*).

Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle's selection of spells is
extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and
two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains
one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–6. Unlike spells per
day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her
Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2–6 are fixed.

In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each
oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to
her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with “cure” in
the name, inflict spells include all spells with “inflict” in the name).
These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them.
This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be
changed.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after
that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in
place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old
spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the
same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a
single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap
the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the
level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any
spells gained from her mystery.

Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She
can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used
up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to
provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as
part of the components.

**Mystery**: Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells
and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other
special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal,
prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to
champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might
have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of
the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless
of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle
gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first
level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.

At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an
additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition
to the number of spells given on Table 2–6. They cannot be exchanged for
different spells at higher levels.

**Oracle's Curse (Ex)**: Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes
with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level,
and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle's curse cannot be
removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle's curse is
based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice
other than oracle. Each oracle must choose one of the following curses.

*Clouded Vision*: Your eyes are obscured, making it difficult for you to
see. You cannot see anything beyond 30 feet, but you can see as if you
had darkvision. At 5th level, this distance increases to 60 feet. At
10th level, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. At 15th
level, you gain blindsight out to a range of 15 feet.

*Deaf*: You cannot hear and suffer all of the usual penalties for being
deafened. You cast all of your spells as if they were modified by the
[Silent Spell](#silent-spell) feat. This does not
increase their level or casting time. At 5th level, you receive a +3
competence bonus on
[Perception](#perception) checks that do
not rely upon hearing, and the initiative penalty for being deaf is
reduced to –2. At 10th level, you gain scent and you do not suffer any
penalty on initiative checks due to being deaf. At 15th level, you gain
tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.

*Haunted*: Malevolent spirits follow you wherever you go, causing minor
mishaps and strange occurrences (such as unexpected breezes, small
objects moving on their own, and faint noises). Retrieving any stored
item from your gear requires a standard action, unless it would normally
take longer. Any item you drop lands 10 feet away from you in a random
direction. Add *[mage hand](#mage-hand)* and
*[ghost sound](#ghost-sound)* to your list
of spells known. At 5th level, add
*[levitate](#levitate)* and *[minor
image](#minor-image)*to your list of spells
known. At 10th level, add
*[telekinesis](#telekinesis)*to your list
of spells known. At 15th level, add *[reverse
gravity](#reverse-gravity)* to your
list of spells known.

*Lame*: One of your legs is permanently wounded, reducing your base land
speed by 10 feet if your base speed is 30 feet or more. If your base
speed is less than 30 feet, your speed is reduced by 5 feet. Your speed
is never reduced due to encumbrance. At 5th level, you are immune to the
fatigued condition (but not exhaustion). At 10th level, your speed is
never reduced by armor. At 15th level, you are immune to the exhausted
condition.

*Tongues*: In times of stress or unease, you speak in tongues. Pick one
of the following languages: Abyssal, Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Celestial,
Ignan, Infernal, or Terran. Whenever you are in combat, you can only
speak and understand the selected language. This does not interfere with
spellcasting, but it does apply to spells that are language dependent.
You gain the selected language as a bonus language. At 5th level, pick
an additional language to speak in combat and add it to your list of
known languages. At 10th level, you can understand any spoken language,
as if under the effects of
*[tongues](#tongues),*even during combat. At
15th level, you can speak and understand any language, but your speech
is still restricted during combat.

*Wasting*: Your body is slowly rotting away. You take a –4 penalty on
Charisma-based skill checks, except for
[Intimidate](#intimidate). You gain a +4
competence bonus on saves made against disease. At 5th level, you are
immune to the sickened condition (but not nauseated). At 10th level, you
gain immunity to disease. At 15th level, you are immune to the nauseated
condition.

**Orisons**: Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as
noted on Table 2–6 under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like any
other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.

**Revelation**: At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels
thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about
her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select
a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a
revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the
abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current
level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a
standard action.

**Final Revelation**: At 20th level, an oracle learns the final
revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities.
The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle's mystery.

Mysteries
=========

Each oracle must choose from among the following mysteries. Unless
otherwise noted, the DC to save against these revelations is equal to 10
+ 1/2 the oracle's level + the oracle's Charisma modifier. Spells marked
with an asterisk (\*) appear in Chapter 5 of this book.

battlecry. All allies within 100 feet who hear your cry gain a +1 morale
bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for a number of
rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. At 10th level, this bonus
increases to +2. You can use this ability once per day, plus one
additional time per day at 5th level and for every five levels
thereafter.

*Battlefield Clarity (Ex)*: Once per day, as an immediate action,
whenever you fail a saving throw that causes you to become blind, deaf,
frightened, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, or stunned, you may attempt
that saving throw again, with a +4 insight bonus on the roll. You must
take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th and 15th level, you
can use this ability one additional time per day.

*Combat Healer (Su)*: Whenever you cast a cure spell (a spell with
“cure” in its name), you can cast it as a swift action, as if using the
[Quicken Spell](#quicken-spell) feat, by expending two
spell slots. This does not increase the level of the spell. You can use
this ability once per day at 7th level and one additional time per day
for every four levels beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level to
select this revelation.

level as the caster level. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice
per day. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

*Maneuver Mastery (Ex)*: Select one type of combat maneuver. When
performing the selected maneuver, you treat your oracle level as your

your CMB. At 7th level, you gain the Improved feat (such as [Improved
Trip](#improved-trip)) that grants you a bonus when
performing that maneuver. At 11th level, you gain the Greater feat (such
as [Greater Trip](#greater-trip)) that grants you a
bonus when performing that maneuver. You do not need to meet the
prerequisites to receive these feats.

*Resiliency (Ex)*: You are not disabled and you do not gain the
staggered condition if you are reduced to exactly 0 hit points. At 7th
level, you gain [Diehard](#diehard) as a bonus feat. At
11th level, you do not lose a hit point when you take a standard action
while disabled. You do not need to meet the prerequisite to receive the
[Diehard](#diehard) feat.

*Skill at Arms (Ex)*: You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and
heavy armor.

*Surprising Charge (Ex)*: Once per day, you can move up to your speed as
an immediate action. You can use this ability one additional time per

*War Sight (Su)*: Whenever you roll for initiative, you can roll twice
and take either result. At 7th level, you can always act in the surprise
round, but if you fail to notice the ambush, you act last, regardless of
your initiative result (you act in the normal order in following
rounds). At 11th level, you can roll for initiative three times and take
any one of the results.

*Weapon Mastery (Ex)*: Select one weapon with which you are proficient.
You gain [Weapon Focus](#weapon-focus) with that
weapon. At 8th level, you gain [Improved
Critical](#improved-critical) with that weapon. At 12th
level, you gain [Greater Weapon
Focus](#greater-weapon-focus) with that weapon. You do
not need to meet the prerequisites to receive these feats.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become an avatar of
battle. You can take a full-attack action and move up to your speed as a
full-round action (you can move before or after the attacks). Whenever
you score a critical hit, you can ignore any DR the target might
possess. You gain a +4 insight bonus to your AC for the purpose of
confirming critical hits against you. When you are below 0 hit points,
you do not die until your negative total is in excess of twice your
Constitution score.

Bones
-----

**Class Skills**: An oracle with a bones mystery adds

this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor grants you DR
5/bludgeoning. You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle
level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be
spent in 1-hour increments.

*Bleeding Wounds (Su)*: Whenever a creature takes damage from one of
your spells or effects that causes negative energy damage (such as
*[inflict light
wounds](#inflict-light-wounds)* or
the death's touch revelation), it begins to bleed, taking 1 point of
damage each round. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this
damage increases by 1. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15
[Heal](#heal) check or any effect that heals
damage.

*Death's Touch (Su)*: You can cause terrible wounds to appear on a
creature with a melee touch attack. This attack deals 1d6 points of
negative energy damage +1 point for every two oracle levels you possess.
If used against an undead creature, it heals damage and grants a +2
channel resistance for 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of
times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Near Death (Su)*: You gain a +2 insight bonus on saves against
diseases, mind-affecting effects, and poisons. At 7th level, this bonus
also applies on saves against death effects, sleep effects, and
stunning. At 11th level, the bonus increases to +4.

*Raise the Dead (Su)*: As a standard action, you can summon a single
skeleton or zombie to serve you. The undead creature has a number of Hit
Dice equal to your oracle level. It remains for a number of rounds equal
to your Charisma modifier. At 7th level, you can summon a bloody
skeleton or fast zombie. At 15th level, you can summon an advanced
skeleton or zombie. You can use this ability once per day plus one
additional time per day at 10th level.

*Resist Life (Su)*: You are treated as an undead creature when you are
targeted by positive or negative energy. You are not subject to [Turn
Undead](#turn-undead) or [Command
Undead](#command-undead) (or any other effect that
specifically targets undead), unless you are actually an undead
creature. At 7th level, you receive channel resistance +2. This bonus
increases by +2 at 11th and 15th level.

*Soul Siphon (Su)*: As a ranged touch attack, you can unleash a ray that
causes a target to gain one negative level. The ray has a range of 30
feet. This negative level lasts for a number of minutes equal to your
Charisma modifier. Whenever this ability gives a target a negative
level, you heal a number of hit points equal to your oracle level. You
can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time at 11th
level and every four levels thereafter. You must be at least 7th level
to select this revelation.

*Spirit Walk (Su)*: As a standard action, you can become incorporeal and
invisible. While in this form, you can move in any direction and through
any object (except for those made of force). You can take no action
other than to move while in this form. You remain in this form for a
number of rounds equal to your oracle level, but you can end this effect
prematurely with a standard action. You can use this ability once per
day at 11th level, and twice per day at 15th level. You must be at least
11th level to select this revelation.

*Undead Servitude (Su)*: You gain [Command
Undead](#command-undead) as a bonus feat. You can
channel negative energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Charisma modifier, but only to use [Command
Undead](#command-undead). You can take other feats to
add to this ability, such as Improved Channeling, but not feats that
alter this ability, such as [Alignment
Channel](#alignment-channel).

*Voice of the Grave (Su)*: You can *[speak with
dead](#speak-with-dead)*, as per the
spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level. These
rounds do not need to be consecutive. At 5th level, and every five
levels thereafter, the dead creature takes a cumulative –2 penalty on
its Will save to resist this effect.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of
death. Once per round, you can cast
*[bleed](#bleed)* or
*[stabilize](#stabilize)*as a free action.
If you are brought to below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize.
You can cast *[animate
dead](#animate-dead)* at will without
paying a material component cost (although you are still subject to the
usual Hit Die control limit). Once per day, you can cast *[power word
kill](#power-word-kill)*, but the spell

Flame
-----

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the flame mystery adds

**Revelations**: An oracle with a flame mystery can choose from any of
the following revelations.

*Burning Magic (Su)*: Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes
fire damage from one of your spells, it catches on fire. This fire deals
1 point of fire damage per spell level at the beginning of the burning
creature's turn. The fire lasts for 1d4 rounds, but it can be
extinguished as a move action if the creature succeeds at a Reflex save
(using the spell's DC). Dousing the creature with water as a standard
action grants a +2 bonus on this save, while immersing the creature in
water automatically extinguishes the fire. Spells that do not grant a
save do not cause a creature to catch on fire.

*Cinder Dance (Ex)*: Your base speed increases by 10 feet. At 5th level,
you receive [Nimble Moves](#nimble-moves) as a bonus
feat. At 10th level, you receive [Acrobatic
Steps](#acrobatic-steps) as a bonus feat. You do not
need to meet the prerequisites to receive these feats. Oracles with the
lame oracle curse cannot select this revelation.

*Fire Breath (Su)*: As a standard action, you can unleash a 15-foot cone
of flame from your mouth. This flame deals 1d4 points of fire damage per
level. A Reflex save halves this damage. You can use this ability once
per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five
levels thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.

*Firestorm (Su)*: As a standard action, you can cause fire to erupt
around you. You can create one 10-foot cube of fire per oracle level.
These cubes can be arranged in any pattern you desire, but each cube
must be adjacent to another and one must be adjacent to you. Any
creature caught in these flames takes 1d6 points of fire damage per
oracle level, with a Reflex save resulting in half damage. This fire
lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. You can
use this ability once per day. You must be at least 11th level to select
this revelation.

*Form of Flame (Su)*: As a standard action, you can assume the form of a
Small fire elemental, as *[elemental body
I](#elemental-body-i)*. At 9th level,
you can assume the form of a Medium fire elemental, as *[elemental body
II](#elemental-body-ii)*. At 11th level,
you can assume the form of a Large fire elemental, as *[elemental body
III](#elemental-body-iii)*. At 13th
level, you can assume the form of a Huge fire elemental, as *[elemental
body IV](#elemental-body-iv)*. You can
use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 hour/level. You
must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

*Gaze of Flames (Su)*: You can see through fire, fog, and smoke without
penalty as long as the light is sufficient to allow you to see normally.
At 7th level, you can gaze through any source of flame within 10 feet
per oracle level, as if using *clairvoyance*. You can use this ability
for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these
rounds do not need to be consecutive.

*Heat Aura (Su)*: As a swift action, you can cause waves of heat to
radiate from your body. This heat deals 1d4 points of fire damage per
two oracle levels (minimum 1d4) to all creatures within 10 feet. A
Reflex save halves the damage. In addition, your form wavers and blurs,
granting you 20% concealment until your next turn. You can use this
ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and
every five levels thereafter.

*Molten Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist fire 5. This resistance increases to
10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity
to fire.

*Touch of Flame (Su)*: As a standard action, you can perform a melee
touch attack that deals 1d6 points of fire damage +1 point for every two
oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon
that you wield is treated as a
*[flaming](#weapons-flaming)*weapon.

*Wings of Fire (Su)*: As a swift action, you can manifest a pair of
fiery wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with average
maneuverability. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per oracle
level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be
spent in 1 minute increments. You must be at least 7th level before
selecting this revelation.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of
fire. You can apply any one of the following feats to any fire spell you
cast without increasing the level or casting time: [Enlarge
Spell](#enlarge-spell), [Extend
Spell](#extend-spell), [Silent

Spell](#still-spell). You do not need to possess these
feats to use this ability.

(14th), *[sunburst](#sunburst)* (16th),
*[meteor swarm](#meteor-swarm)* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the heavens mystery can choose from any
of the following revelations.

*Awesome Display (Su)*: Your phantasmagoric displays accurately model
the mysteries of the night sky, dumbfounding all who behold them. Each
creature affected by your illusion (pattern) spells is treated as if its
total number of Hit Dice were equal to its number of Hit Dice minus your
Charisma modifier (if positive).

*Coat of Many Stars (Su)*: You conjure a coat of starry radiance that
grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels
thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor grants
you DR 5/slashing. You can use this coat for 1 hour per day per oracle
level. The duration does not need to be consecutive; it can instead be
spent in 1-hour increments.

*Dweller in [Darkness](#darkness) (Sp)*: Once
per day, you cast your psyche into the void of space to attract the
attention of a terrible otherworldly being. The dweller in darkness
behaves in all ways as if you had cast *[phantasmal
killer](#phantasmal-killer)*. At 17th
level, the dweller in darkness can be perceived by more than one
creature, as if you had cast *[weird](#weird)*.
You must be at least 11th level to choose this revelation.

*Guiding Star (Su)*: Whenever you can see the open sky at night, you can
determine your precise location. When the night sky is visible to you,
you may also add your Charisma modifier to your Wisdom modifier on all
Wisdom-based checks. In addition, once per night while outdoors, you can
cast one spell as if it were modified by the [Empower
Spell](#empower-spell), [Extend
Spell](#extend-spell), [Silent
Spell](#silent-spell), or Still spell feat without
increasing the spell's casting time or level.

*Interstellar Void (Su)*: You call upon the frigid depths of outer space
to bring a terrible chill to your enemies. As a standard action, one
target within 30 feet is cloaked in the void and takes 1d6 points of
cold damage per level. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage.
At 10th level, the interstellar void is so extreme that enemies who fail
their saving throw are fatigued. At 15th level, creatures who fail their
save are exhausted and stunned for 1 round. You can use this ability
once per day plus one additional time per day at 10th level.

*Lure of the Heavens (Su)*: Your connection to the skies above is so
strong that your feet barely touch the ground. At 1st level, you no
longer leave tracks. At 5th level, you can hover up to 6 inches above
the ground or even above liquid surfaces, as if levitating. At 10th
level, you gain the ability to *[fly]()*, as per
the spell, for a number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level.
This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in
1-minute increments.

*Mantle of Moonlight (Su)*: Your innate understanding of the moon
renders you immune to lycanthropy. Additionally, you may disrupt a
lycanthrope's connection to the moon with a successful touch attack.
This action automatically forces the lycanthrope into its humanoid form,
which it must remain in for a number of rounds equal to your oracle
level. Upon reaching 5th level, you can use this ability to force others
into a *[rage](#rage)*, as per the spell. Using
this ability is a melee touch attack. You can use this ability once per
day at 5th level plus one additional time per day for every 5 levels
above 5th.

*Moonlight Bridge (Su)*: You summon a bridge of shimmering moonlight.
The 10-foot-wide span touches the ground at a point adjacent to your
position. From this point it can extend in any direction for 10 feet per
oracle level. The path persists until you have crossed over the bridge
or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter. You may summon a moonlight bridge
a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Should the
bridge be attacked, treat it as a *[wall of
force](#wall-of-force)*.

*Spray of Shooting Stars (Su):* As a standard action, you can unleash a
ball of energy that explodes in a 5-foot-radius burst dealing 1d4 points
of fire damage per level. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
This attack has a range of 60 feet. You can fire one explosive ball per
day, plus one additional ball per day at 5th level and for every 5
levels thereafter. You can fire more than one ball at a time, but
creatures caught inside more than one simultaneous explosions only take
damage once.

*Star Chart (Ex)*: Your copious notes contain a working model of the
night sky expressed in artistic scribbles and arcane mathematical
formulae. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes contemplating your star
chart to gain the benefit of the spell
*[commune](#commune)*. You must be at least
7th level to select this revelation.

**Final Revelation**: Upon achieving 20th level, your rapport with the
heavens grants you perfect harmony with the universe. You receive a
bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier. You
automatically stabilize if you are below 0 hit points, are immune to
fear effects, and automatically confirm all critical hits. Should you
die, you are reborn 3 days later in the form of a star child, who
matures over the course of 7 days (treat as the
*[reincarnate](#reincarnate)* spell).

(14th), *[mass heal](#heal-mass)* (16th), *[true
resurrection](#true-resurrection)*
(18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the life mystery can choose from any of
the following revelations.

*Channel (Su)*: You can channel positive energy like a cleric, using
your oracle level as your effective cleric level when determining the
amount of damage healed (or caused to undead) and the DC. You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma
modifier.

*Combat Healer (Su)*: As the battle mystery revelation.

*Delay Affliction (Su)*: Once per day as an immediate action, whenever
you fail a saving throw against a disease or poison, you may ignore its
effects for 1 hour per level. At 7th and 15th level, you can use this
ability one additional time per day.

*Energy Body (Su)*: As a standard action, you can transform your body
into pure life energy, resembling a golden-white fire elemental. In this
form, you gain the elemental subtype and give off a warm, welcoming
light that increases the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to
normal light. Any undead creature striking you with its body or a
handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker
takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage + 1 point per oracle level.
Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this
damage if they attack you. If you grapple or attack an undead creature
using unarmed strikes or natural weapons, you may deal this damage in
place of the normal damage for the attack. Once per round, if you pass
through a living allied creature's square or the ally passes through
your square, it heals 1d6 hit points + 1 per oracle level. You may use
this ability to heal yourself as a move action. You choose whether or
not to heal a creature when it passes through your space. You may return
to your normal form as a free action. You may remain in energy body form
for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level.

*Enhanced Cures (Su)*: Whenever you cast a cure spell, the maximum
number of hit points healed is based on your oracle level, not the limit
based on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of life with this
revelation may cast *[cure light
wounds](#cure-light-wounds)* to heal
1d8+11 hit points instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.

*Healing Hands (Ex)*: You gain a +4 bonus on
[Heal](#heal) checks. You may provide first aid
to two people or treat two people for poison as a standard action (make
a separate [Heal](#heal) check for each
creature). When using the [Heal](#heal) skill to
treat wounds from caltrops (and so on), treat deadly wounds, treat
poison, treat disease, or treat long-term care, you may treat double the
normal number of people you may treat at the same time. You may provide
long-term care for yourself.

*Life Link (Su)*: As a standard action, you may create a bond between
yourself and another creature. Each round at the start of your turn, if
the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its
maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and you take 5 hit points of
damage. You may have one bond active per oracle level. This bond
continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between
you and the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an
immediate action (if you have multiple bonds active, you may end as many
as you want as part of the same immediate action).

*Lifesense (Su)*: You notice and locate living creatures within 30 feet,
just as if you possessed the blindsight ability. You must be at least
11th level to select this revelation.

*Safe Curing (Su)*: Whenever you cast a spell that cures the target of
hit point damage, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for
spellcasting.

*Spirit Boost (Su)*: Whenever your healing spells heal a target up to
its maximum hit points, any excess points persist for 1 round per level
as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points
equal to your oracle level).

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a perfect
channel for life energy. You become immune to bleed, death attacks,
exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened
effects. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce you below 1 in any
ability score. You automatically make saving throws against massive
damage. When you are below 0 hit points, you do not die until your
negative total is in excess of twice your Constitution score.

*[vision](#vision)* (14th), *[moment of
prescience](#moment-of-prescience)*
(16th), *[time stop](#time-stop)* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the lore mystery can choose from any of
the following revelations.

*Arcane Archivist (Su)*: Your experience with lore-filled tomes has
granted you the ability to cast arcane spells as if they were on your
spell list. Once per day, you can cast a spell from the sorcerer/wizard
spell list as if it were on your list of spells known. The spell
consumes a spell slot one level higher than the level of the spell. You
must have a spellbook containing the spell to cast it in this way, and
the spell is erased when you complete the casting. You must be at least
11th level to select this revelation.

*Automatic Writing (Su)*: Once per day, you can spend a full hour in
uninterrupted meditation. During this period, your hands produce
mysterious writing that pertains to the future. At 1st level, the
prophetic writing manifests as an
*[augury](#augury)* spell with 90%
effectiveness. At 5th level, the writing takes the form of a
*[divination](#divination)* with 90%
effectiveness. At 8th level, the writing manifests as a casting of
*[commune](#commune)* with no material
component required.

*Brain Drain (Su)*: You can take a standard action to violently probe
the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 100 feet. The target
receives a Will save to negate the effect and immediately knows the
source of this harmful mental prying. Those who fail this save are
wracked with pain, taking 1d4 points of damage per oracle level. After
successfully attacking with this ability, you may use a full-round
action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to
make a single [Knowledge](#knowledge) check
using the victim's skill bonus. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in
your mind for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. Treat
the knowledge gained as if you used *[detect
thoughts](#detect-thoughts)*. This is a
mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability once per day at 1st
level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5
levels beyond 5th.

*Focused Trance (Ex)*: You can enter a deep meditation, blocking out
visual and auditory stimuli and allowing you to concentrate on a single
problem, philosophical issue, or memory. This trance lasts 1d6 rounds,
during which time you can only take move actions. During this period,
you gain a bonus equal to your level on all saves against sonic effects
and gaze attacks. When you come out of your trance, you may make a
single Intelligence-based skill check with a +20 circumstance bonus. You
may enter your focused trance a number of times per day equal to your
Charisma modifier.

*Lore Keeper (Ex)*: Instead of encyclopedic knowledge, you learn most of
your information through tales, songs, and poems. You may use your
Charisma modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier on all
[Knowledge](#knowledge) checks.

*Mental Acuity (Ex)*: Your explorations into the secret mysteries of the
world have granted you a preternatural understanding of all things-and
you just keep getting smarter. You gain a +1 inherent bonus to
Intelligence upon taking this revelation and another at every third
oracle level gained thereafter. You must be at least 7th level to select
this revelation.

*[Sidestep](#sidestep-(combat)) Secret (Su)*: Your
innate understanding of the universe has granted you preternatural
reflexes and the uncanny ability to step out of danger at the very last
second. Add your Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier)
to your Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor's maximum
Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma instead of your Dexterity.

*Spontaneous Symbology*: Your knowledge of the secret history of the
world has unveiled the mysterious symbols that govern reality. You can
cast any “symbol” spell using a spell slot of the appropriate level,
even if the spell is not on your list of spells known. A symbol spell is
any spell with the word “symbol” in its name. You must be at least 11th
level to select this revelation.

*Think On It (Ex)*: Once per day, the oracle of lore can re-attempt any
previously failed [Knowledge](#knowledge)
check. On this attempt, add a +10 competence bonus on the check.

*[Whirlwind](#whirlwind) Lesson (Ex)*: You
can quickly browse through a magical tome or manual, gaining its
benefits with only a single 8-hour study session (rather than the usual
48 hours over a period of 6 days). At 7th level, you may allow another
character to join in your study; both of you gain the full benefit of
having read the book. At 15th level, you may share your whirlwind lesson
with a number of characters equal to your oracle level. The benefits to
you are permanent, whereas your students gain the tome or manual's
benefits for a number of days equal to your Charisma modifier but then
forget what they have learned.

**Final Revelation**: You gain the ability to take 20 on all
[Knowledge](#knowledge) skill checks. Your
understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of reality has also
become so advanced that once per day, you can cast
*[wish](#wish)*. This ability does not require a
material component, but the *[wish](#wish)*cannot
be used to grant ability score bonuses, nor can it be used to replicate
spells with expensive material components.

Nature
------

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the nature mystery adds
[Climb](#climb),
[Fly](#fly),
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (nature),
[Ride](#ride),
[Survival](#survival), and
[Swim](#swim) to her list of class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[charm
animal](#charm-animal)* (2nd),
*[barkskin](#barkskin)* (4th), *[speak with
plants](#speak-with-plants)* (6th),
*[grove of respite\*](#grove-of-respite)*

doom](#creeping-doom)* (14th), *[animal
shapes](#animal-shapes)* (16th), *[world
wave\*](#world-wave-)* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the nature mystery can choose from any
of the following revelations.

*Bonded [Mount](#mount) (Su)*: You gain the
service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal mount. The
creature must be one that you are capable of riding and is suitable as a
mount. A Medium oracle can select a camel or a horse. A Small oracle can
select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at
least 4th level. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion,
using your oracle level as your effective druid level. Bonded mounts
have an Intelligence score of at least 6.

*Erosion Touch (Su)*: As a melee touch attack, you can deal 1d6 points
of damage per level to objects or constructs. If used against an object
in another creature's possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat
maneuver. You can use this ability once per day, plus one time per day
for every three levels you possess.

*Friend to the Animals (Ex)*: Add all *summon nature's ally* spells to
your spell list. You must still select these spells using your allotment
of spells known. Animals within 30 feet of you receive a bonus on all
saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier.

*Life Leach (Su)*: You can draw life force from the bodies of enemies
and channel it into yourself. As a standard action, you can drain the
life essence from one living target within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6
points of damage per two levels you possess (maximum 10d6). You gain
temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more
than the target's current hit points + the target's Constitution score
(which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points last a
number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier. The target receives a
Fortitude save to halve the damage (and the temporary hit points you
gain). You may use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one
additional time per day for every 4 levels you possess beyond 7th. You
must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.

*Natural Divination (Ex)*: You can read the entrails of a freshly killed
animal or humanoid to gain an insight bonus equal to your Charisma
modifier on one saving throw. Alternatively, by observing and
interpreting the flights of birds, you may apply a +10 competence bonus
on any one skill check. Finally, by charting marks in dirt or stone, or
observing the behavior of sand when thrown into the wind, you gain a +4
insight bonus on one initiative check. These bonuses must be used during
the next 24 hours and you must declare you are using the bonus before
the check or save is made. Making a natural divination takes 10 minutes.
You may use natural divination (in any combination) once per day plus
one additional time per day for every four oracle levels you have
attained.

*Nature's Whispers (Ex)*: You have become so attuned to the whispers of
the natural world, from the croaking of frogs to the groaning of great
boulders, that your surroundings constantly keep you preternaturally
aware of danger. You may add your Charisma modifier, instead of your
Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that
would cause you to lose your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class
instead causes you to lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.

*Speak with Animals (Ex)*: Choose a specific kind of animal (eagle, fox,
dog, and so on). You gain the ability to converse with that type of
animal as if you were under the effects of *speak with animal*. You gain
the ability to communicate with an additional kind of animal for every 3
oracle levels you have attained.

*Spirit of Nature (Su)*: When in a natural setting, whenever you are
reduced to negative hit points, you automatically stabilize. At 5th
level, you gain fast healing 1 for 1d4 rounds whenever you are reduced
to negative hit points. At 10th level, the ability works everywhere,
even in civilized or wholly artificial realms. At 15th level, you gain
fast healing 3 for 1d4 rounds when reduced to negative hit points.

*Transcendental Bond (Su)*: You become so attuned to the common spirit
shared by all living things that you can use it to communicate with
allies. You may communicate with your allies for a number of rounds per
day equal to your oracle level as if using *[telepathic
bond](#telepathic-bond)*. You may
designate a number of creatures as your ally equal to your Charisma
modifier. Designating a creature is a standard action that requires a
touch. At 10th level, you may use this bond to cast a touch spell on a
designated ally once per day.

*Undo Artifice (Sp)*: At 11th-level, you gain the ability to reduce a
nonliving item to its component parts, essentially erasing the hand of
artifice and rendering the item into a pile of raw natural materials.
This effect acts as the spell *[polymorph any
object](#polymorph-any-object)*,
working on both magical and nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration
is always permanent. Unlike *[polymorph any
object](#polymorph-any-object)*, it
cannot be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to
this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect. Magic
items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every
5,000 gp in the item's value. You may use undo artifice a number of
times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.

**Final Revelation**: At 20th level, you have discovered the intrinsic
secrets of life itself, granting you incredible control over your own
body. Once per day, you can surround yourself with an organic cocoon as
a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, you are considered
helpless. Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to
plant, animal, or humanoid, gaining superficial physical characteristics
as appropriate (see the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). This change does not
alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class
skills, or proficiencies. Each time the transformation is made, you are
cleansed of all poisons or diseases, are restored to full hit points,
and heal all ability damage. You must select a new type every time the
transformation is made.

Stone

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the stone mystery adds
[Appraise](#appraise),
[Climb](#climb),
[Intimidate](#intimidate), and
[Survival](#survival) to her list of class
skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[magic
stone](#magic-stone)* (2nd), *[stone
call\*](#stone-call)* (4th), *[meld into
stone](#meld-into-stone)* (6th), *[wall
of stone](#wall-of-stone)* (8th),

*[statue](#statue)* (14th), *[repel metal or
stone](#repel-metal-or-stone)*
(16th), *[clashing
rocks\*](#clashing-rocks)* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the stone mystery can choose from any of
the following revelations.

*Acid Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist acid 5. This resistance increases to
10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity
to acid.

*Clobbering Strike (Ex)*: Whenever you score a critical hit against an
opponent with a spell that requires an attack roll, you may immediately
attempt to trip your opponent as a swift action. You do not provoke an
attack of opportunity as normal for this trip attempt. You cannot be
tripped in return when using this ability.

*Crystal Sight (Ex)*: You can see through stone, earth, or sand as
easily as if it were transparent crystal. Your gaze can penetrate a
number of feet equal to your oracle level, or 1/12th this thickness of
metal. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your
oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

*Earth [Glide](#glide-) (Su)*: You can pass through
stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except worked stone and
metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire
damage, you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land
speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do not
need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or
hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your presence. A *[move
earth](#move-earth)* spell cast on an area
where you are flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless
you succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Activating this ability is a free
action. You can glide for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This
duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in
1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this
revelation. You can bring other creatures with you when you glide, but
each passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.

*Mighty Pebble (Su)*: As a standard action, you can charge and throw a
pebble (or other stone of similar size) that detonates when it strikes a
target as a ranged attack. The pebble has a range increment of 20 feet
and has a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage for every four
oracle levels you possess. Any creature struck by the pebble takes 1d6
points of bludgeoning damage per two oracle levels you possess (minimum
1d6). Creatures in squares adjacent to the target take half damage, or
no damage if they make a Reflex saving throw. If the attack roll misses,
treat the pebble as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands.
You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.

*Rock [Throwing](#throwing) (Ex)*: You are
an accomplished rock thrower and have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls
with thrown rocks. You can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than
your own size. The range increment for a rock is 20 feet, and you can
hurl it up to 5 range increments. Damage for a hurled rock is 2d4 for a
Medium creature or 2d3 for a Small creature, plus 1-1/2 your Strength
bonus.

*Shard Explosion (Su)*: As a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces
of stone to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points
of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures
within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition,
the broken shards make the area difficult terrain until your next turn.
You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.

*Steelbreaker Skin (Su)*: As a standard action, you can harden your
flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or destroyed. Anytime
a melee or ranged weapon strikes you, the weapon takes an amount of
damage equal to your oracle level. This ability does not prevent the
weapon from harming you unless the damage destroys the weapon attacking
you. You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1
minute/level. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.
At 15th level, the damage from this ability ignores up to 10 points of
hardness.

*Stone Stability (Ex)*: You receive a +4 bonus to your Combat Maneuver
Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the
ground. At 5th level, you gain [Improved
Trip](#improved-trip) as a bonus feat. At 10th level,
you gain [Greater Trip](#greater-trip) as a bonus feat.
You do not need to meet the prerequisites to gain these feats.

*Touch of Acid (Su)*: As a standard action, you can perform a melee
touch attack that deals 1d6 points of acid damage +1 point for every two
oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon
that you wield deals +1d6 points of acid damage, similar to how a
*[flaming](#weapons-flaming)* weapon
operates.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of
acid and earth. You can apply any one of the following feats to any acid
or earth spell without increasing the level or casting time: [Enlarge
Spell](#enlarge-spell), [Extend
Spell](#extend-spell), [Silent
Spell](#silent-spell), or [Still
Spell](#still-spell).

Waves

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the waves mystery adds
[Acrobatics](#acrobatics), [Escape

*[vortex\*](#vortex)* (14th),
*[seamantle\*](#seamantle)* (16th),
*[tsunami\*](#tsunami)* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the waves mystery can choose from any of
the following revelations.

*Blizzard (Su)*: As a standard action, you can create a blizzard of snow
and ice. You can create one 10-foot-cube of storm per oracle level.
These cubes can be arranged in any pattern you desire, but each cube
must be adjacent to another and one must be adjacent to you. Any
creature caught in the blizzard takes 1d4 points of cold damage per
oracle level, with a Reflex save resulting in half damage. The storm
lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier; the ground
remains icy (+5 to
[Acrobatics](#acrobatics) DCs) as long as
local conditions permit. The blizzard obscures sight beyond 5 feet,
providing total concealment. A creature within 5 feet has concealment.
You can use this ability once per day. You must be 11th level to select
this revelation.

*Fluid Nature (Ex)*: You receive a +4 bonus to your Combat Maneuver
Defense against bull rush, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip attempts.
A creature trying to confirm a critical hit against you has a –4 penalty
on its confirmation roll. At 5th level, you gain
[Dodge](#dodge) as a bonus feat. You do not need to
meet the prerequisite to gain this feat.

*Fluid Travel (Su)*: You can walk on liquid as if it were a solid
surface. Walking on the liquid does not harm you; you can walk on acid
or even lava (as if walking on a solid temporary crust), though you
would still take fire damage from being near the lava. You can move
across this surface at your normal land speed. At 7th level, while this
ability is in effect, you can instead go underwater, gaining a swim
speed of 60 feet and the ability to breathe water. You can use this
ability for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need
to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Freezing Spells (Su)*: Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and
takes cold damage from one of your spells, it is slowed (as the
*[slow](#slow)* spell) for 1 round. Spells that
do not allow a save do not slow creatures. At 11th level, the duration
increases to 1d4 rounds.

*Ice Armor (Su)*: You can conjure armor of ice that grants you a +4
armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus
increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor grants you DR 5/piercing. In
cold conditions, the armor bonus (and DR bonus) increases by 2; in very
hot conditions it decreases by 2. You can use this armor for 1 hour per
day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but
it must be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Icy Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist cold 5. This resistance increases to 10
at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity to
cold.

*Punitive
[Transformation](#transformation)
(Su)*: You can transform an opponent into a harmless animal as if using
*[baleful
polymorph](#baleful-polymorph)*. This
transformation lasts 1 round per oracle level. Transforming another
creature causes the first to immediately revert to normal. You may use
this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.
You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.

*Water Form (Su)*: As a standard action, you can assume the form of a
Small water elemental, as *[elemental body
I](#elemental-body-i)*. At 9th level,
you can assume the form of a Medium water elemental, as *[elemental body
II](#elemental-body-ii)*. At 11th level,
you can assume the form of a Large water elemental, as *[elemental body
III](#elemental-body-iii)*. At 13th
level, you can assume the form of a Huge water elemental, as *[elemental
body IV](#elemental-body-iv)*. You can
use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 hour/level. You
must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

*Water Sight (Su)*: You can see through fog and mist without penalty as
long as there is enough light to allow you to see normal. At 7th level,
you can use any calm pool of water at least 1 foot in diameter as a
scrying device, as if using the *scry* spell. At 15th level, this
functions like *[greater
scrying](#scrying-greater)*.You can use the
scrying abilities for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle
level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

*Wintry Touch (Su)*: As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch
attack that deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two
oracle levels you possess. You can use the wintry touch ability a number
of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any
weapon that you wield is treated as a
*[frost](#weapons-frost)* weapon.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of
cold and water. You can apply any one of the following feats to any cold
or water spell without increasing the level or casting time: [Enlarge
Spell](#enlarge-spell), [Extend
Spell](#extend-spell), [Silent
Spell](#silent-spell), or [Still
Spell](#still-spell).

(18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the wind mystery can choose from any of
the following revelations.

*Air Barrier (Ex)*: You can create an invisible shell of air that grants
you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter,
this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this barrier causes incoming
arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks requiring an attack roll against
you to have a 50% miss chance. You can use this barrier for 1 hour per
day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but
it must be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Gaseous Form (Su)*: As a standard action, you can assume *[gaseous
form](#gaseous-form)* (as the spell). You
can remain gaseous for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration
does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.
You can bring other creatures with you in gaseous form, but each
passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.

*[Invisibility](#invisibility) (Su)*: As
a standard action, you can become invisible (as per the
*[invisibility](#invisibility)*spell).
You can remain invisible for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This
duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in
1-minute increments. Starting at 9th level, each time you activate this
ability you can treat it as *[greater
invisibility](#invisibility-greater)*,
though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your
normal*[invisibility](#invisibility)*
duration. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.

*Lightning Breath (Su)*: As a standard action, you can breathe a 30-foot
line of electricity. This line deals 1d4 points of electricity damage
per oracle level. A Reflex save halves this damage. You can use this
ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and
every five levels thereafter.

*[Spark](#spark-) Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist
electricity 5. This resistance increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at
11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity to electricity.

*Thunderburst (Ex)*: As a standard action, you can create a blast of air
accompanied by a loud peal of thunder. The blast has a range of 100 feet
and has a 20-foot radius, increasing by 5 feet for every 4 oracle levels
after 7th. Creatures in the area take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage
per oracle level and are deafened for 1 hour, with a Fortitude save
resulting in half damage and no deafness. You must be at least 7th level
to select this revelation. You can use this ability once per day, plus
one additional time per day at 11th level and every four levels
thereafter.

*Touch of Electricity (Su)*: As a standard action, you can perform a
melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage +1 point
for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability a
number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th
level, any weapon that you wield is treated as a
*[shock](#weapons-shock)* weapon.

*[Vortex](#vortex) Spells (Ex)*: Whenever you
score a critical hit against an opponent with an attack spell, the
target is staggered for 1 round. At 11th level, the duration increases
to 1d4 rounds.

*Wind Sight (Ex)*: You ignore penalties on
[Perception](#perception) checks based on
wind and the first 100 feet of distance. At 7th level, as a standard
action, you can see and hear into any area (as if using *clairaudience*
and *clairvoyance*) within range as long as there is an unobstructed
path for air to travel between you and the target area (this does not
require line of effect, meaning the path can turn corners and go through
spaces no smaller than 1 inch in diameter). You can use this ability a
number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do
not need to be consecutive.

*Wings of Air (Su)*: As a swift action, you can manifest a pair of
translucent, cloud-like wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with
good maneuverability. At 10th level, your speed increases to 90 feet and
your maneuverability increases to perfect. You can use these wings for 1
minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be
consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at
least 7th level to select this revelation.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of
air and electricity. You can apply any one of the following feats to any
air or electricity spell without increasing the level or casting time:
[Enlarge Spell](#enlarge-spell), [Extend
Spell](#extend-spell), [Silent
Spell](#silent-spell), or [Still
Spell](#still-spell).

Summoner

Summoner
========

While many who dabble in the arcane become adept at beckoning monsters
from the farthest reaches of the planes, none are more skilled at it
than the summoner. This practitioner of the arcane arts forms a close
bond with one particular outsider, known as an eidolon, who gains power
as the summoner becomes more proficient at his summoning. Over time, the
two become linked, eventually even sharing a shard of the same soul. But
this power comes with a price: the summoner's spells and abilities are
limited due to his time spent enhancing the power and exploring the
nature of his eidolon.

**Role**: Summoners spend much of their time exploring the arcane arts
alongside their eidolons. While their power comes from within, they rely
heavily on their eidolon companions in dangerous situations. While a
summoner and his eidolon function as individuals, their true power lies
in what they can accomplish together.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

Class Features
==============

The following are the class features of the summoner.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Summoners are proficient with all
simple weapons. Summoners are also proficient with light armor. A
summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without
incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane
spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a
shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question
has a somatic component. A multiclass summoner still incurs the normal
arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other
classes.

**Spells**: A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell
list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time,
assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the
spell's level.

To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against a summoner's spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner's
Charisma modifier.

A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level
each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–7. In
addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma
score (see Table 1–3 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*).

A summoner's selection of spells is extremely limited. A summoner begins
play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the
summoner's choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new
spells as indicated on Table 2–8. (Unlike spells per day, the number of
spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The
numbers on Table 2–8 are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter
(8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in
place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner “loses” the old
spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the
same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one
level lower than the highest-level summoner spell he can cast. A
summoner may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must
choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains
new spells known for the level.

**Cantrips**: A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells,
as noted on Table 2–8 under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like
any other spell, but they may be cast any number of times per day.
Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for
example, consume spell slots as normally.

**Eidolon**: A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his
side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link
with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same
creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls
it and can speak all of his languages. Eidolons are treated as summoned
creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until
reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than
their Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner,
an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by *[protection from
evil](#protection-from-evil)* and
similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.

A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to
perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon hit points are unchanged
from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the
eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit
points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until
dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent
back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until
the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by
means of *[dispel magic](#dispel-magic)*,
but spells such as
*[dismissal](#dismissal)*and
*[banishment](#banishment)* work normally.
If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is
immediately banished.

The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner's desires. The eidolon's
Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the
summoner's class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In
addition, each eidolon receives a pool of evolution points, based on the
summoner's class level, that can be used to give the eidolon different
abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must
decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains
another level of summoner.

The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always
appears as some sort of fantastical creature. This control is not fine
enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon
also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on
the summoner's forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this
rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through
magic that changes appearance, such as *[alter
self](#alter-self)* or
*[polymorph](#polymorph)* (although
*[invisibility](#invisibility)*does
conceal it as long as the spell lasts).

**Life Link (Su)**: Starting at 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond
with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it
back to its home plane, the summoner can, as a free action, sacrifice
any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents
1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from
being sent back to its home plane.

In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of
one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon
is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum
hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000
feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point
totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away,
it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in
this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner,
but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.

***Summon Monster I* (Sp)**: Starting at 1st level, a summoner can cast
*[summon monster I](#summon-monster-i)*
as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his
Charisma modifier. Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as
the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this
ability when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a
standard action and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead
of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the
power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to
summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of *[summon monster
IX](#summon-monster-ix)* at 17th level).
At 19th level, this ability can be used as
*[gate](#gate)* or *[summon monster
IX](#summon-monster-ix)*. If used as
*[gate](#gate)*, the summoner must pay any
required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one
*summon monster* or *[gate](#gate)*spell active
in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing
*summon monster* or *[gate](#gate)* immediately
ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of his spell list
for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In
addition, he can expend uses of this ability to fufill the construction
requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this
ability to cast the required spell.

**Bond Senses (Su)**: Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can, as a
standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing,
smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use
this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level.
There is no range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must
be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.

**Shield Ally (Ex)**: At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his
eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to his Armor
Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does
not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or
unconscious.

**Maker's Call (Su)**: At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner
can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as *[dimension
door](#dimension-door)*, using the
summoner's caster level. When used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the
summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied).
If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can
use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per
day for every four levels beyond 6th.

**Transposition (Su)**: At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker's
call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If it is larger than
him, he can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon
must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as
close as possible if it is not able.

**Aspect (Su)**: At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points
from his eidolon's evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He
cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he
must be able to meet the requirements as well. He cannot select the
ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in
this way are taken from the eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total
number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions
he receives from these points any time he can change the eidolon's
evolutions.

**Greater Shield Ally (Su)**: At 12th level, whenever an ally is within
an eidolon's reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to its Armor
Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is
the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if
the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.

**Life Bond (Su)**: At 14th level, a summoner's life becomes linked to
his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the
summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would
reduce the summoner to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to
the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that
as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative his points
equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the
summoner. Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this
ability. This ability does not affect spells like *[baleful
polymorph](#baleful-polymorph)*,*[flesh
to stone](#flesh-to-stone)*, or
*[imprisonment](#imprisonment)*, or other
spells that do not cause actual damage.

**Merge Forms (Su)**: At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner
can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation
includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the
summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or
effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are
suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although
durations continue to expire).

The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control
of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components
used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even though
they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the
eidolon's actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can
speak through its voice.

The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal
to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift
action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if
able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is
merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points
of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.

**Greater Aspect (Su)**: At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of
his eidolon's evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the
aspect ability, but up to 6 evolution points can be taken. Unlike the
aspect ability, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for
every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner.

**Twin Eidolon (Su)**: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a
true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape
of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base
scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries
become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph
subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while
absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all
racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of
the abilities granted by his eidolon's evolutions. The summoner retains
all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number
of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not
need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The
summoner can end this effect as a free action.

Eidolons
========

An eidolon's abilities are determined by the summoner's level and by the
choices made using its evolution pool. Table 2–9: Eidolon Base
Statistics determines many of the base statistics of the eidolon. Each
eidolon possesses a base form that modifies these base statistics.
Eidolons are outsiders for the purpose of determining which spells
affect them.

**Class Level**: This is the character's summoner level.

**HD**: This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the eidolon
possesses, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.

**BAB**: This is the eidolon's base attack bonus. An eidolon's base
attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Eidolons do not gain additional
attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.

**Good/Bad Saves**: These are the eidolon's base saving throw bonuses.
An eidolon possesses two good saving throws and one bad saving throw,
determined by the creature's base form.

**Skills**: This lists the eidolon's total skill ranks. An eidolon can
assign skill ranks to any skill, but it must possess the appropriate
appendages to use some skills. Eidolons with Intelligence scores above
the base value modify these totals as normal (an eidolon receives a
number of skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per HD). An
eidolon cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Eidolon
skill ranks are set once chosen, even if the creature changes when the
summoner gains a new level.

**Feats**: This is the total number of feats possessed by an eidolon.
Eidolons can select any feat that they qualify for, but they must
possess the appropriate appendages to use some feats. Eidolon feats are
set once chosen, even if the creature changes when the summoner gains a
new level. If, due to changes, the eidolon no longer qualifies for a
feat, the feat has no effect until the eidolon once again qualifies for
the feat.

**Armor Bonus**: The number noted here is the eidolon's base total armor
bonus. This bonus may be split between an armor bonus and a natural
armor bonus, as decided by the summoner. This number is modified by the
eidolon's base form and some options available through its evolution
pool. An eidolon cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes
with the summoner's connection to the eidolon.

**Str/Dex Bonus**: Add this modifier to the eidolon's Strength and
Dexterity scores, as determined by its base form. Some options available
through the eidolon's evolution pool might modify these scores.

**Evolution Pool**: The value given in this column is the total number
of points in the eidolon's evolution pool. Points from this pool can be
spent on a wide variety of modifications and upgrades that add new
abilities, attacks, and powers to the eidolon. Whenever the summoner
gains a level, the number in this pool increases and the summoner can
spend these points to change the abilities of the eidolon. These choices
are not set. The summoner can change them whenever he gains a level (and
through the
*[transmogrify](#transmogrify)*spell).

**Max. Attacks**: This indicates the maximum number of natural attacks
that the eidolon is allowed to possess at the given level. If the
eidolon is at its maximum, it cannot take evolutions that grant
additional natural attacks. This does not include attacks made with
weapons.

**Special**: This includes a number of abilities gained by all eidolons
as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.

*[Darkvision](#darkvision) (Ex)*: The
eidolon has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

*Link (Ex)*: A summoner and his eidolon share a mental link allows for
communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same
plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the summoner to
give orders to his eidolon at any time. In addition, magic items
interfere with the summoner's connection to his eidolon. As a result,
the summoner and his eidolon share magic item slots. For example, if the
summoner is wearing a ring, his eidolon can wear no more than one ring.
In case of a conflict, the items worn by the summoner remain active, and
those used by the eidolon become dormant. The eidolon must possess the
appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.

*Share Spells (Ex)*: The summoner may cast a spell with a target of
“you” on his eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on
himself. A summoner may cast spells on his eidolon even if the spells
normally do not affect creatures of the eidolon's type (outsider).
Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner spell list. This
ability does not allow the eidolon to share abilities that are not
spells, even if they function like spells.

*Evasion (Ex)*: If an eidolon is subjected to an attack that normally
allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a
successful saving throw.

*Ability Score Increase (Ex)*: The eidolon adds +1 to one of its ability
scores.

*Devotion (Ex)*: An eidolon gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves
against enchantment spells and effects.

*[Multiattack](#multiattack)*: An
eidolon gains
[Multiattack](#multiattack) as a bonus
feat if it has 3 or more natural attacks and does not already have that
feat. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more natural attacks (or it
is reduced to less than 3 attacks), the eidolon instead gains a second
attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty. If the
eidolon later gains 3 or more natural attacks, it loses this additional
attack and instead gains
[Multiattack](#multiattack).

*Improved Evasion (Ex)*: When subjected to an attack that allows a
Reflex saving throw for half damage, an eidolon takes no damage if it
makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw
fails.

The following skills are class skills for eidolons:
[Bluff](#bluff) (Cha),
[Craft](#craft) (Int),
[Knowledge](#knowledge) (planes) (Int),
[Perception](#perception) (Wis), [Sense
Motive](#sense-motive) (Wis), and
[Stealth](#stealth) (Dex). In addition, at 1st
level, the summoner can choose 4 additional skills to be class skills
for his eidolon. Note that eidolons with a fly speed receive
[Fly](#fly) (Dex) as a free class skill, even if
they do not gain a fly speed until a later level.

Base Forms
----------

Each eidolon has one of three base forms that determines its starting
size, speed, AC, attacks, and ability scores. All natural attacks are
made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted
(such as in the case of secondary attacks). Eidolon attacks add the
eidolon's Strength modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only
attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. These
base forms also note any free evolutions that base form possesses. The
bonuses from these free evolutions are already factored into the
starting statistics.

Alternatively, any one of these base forms can be used to make a Small
eidolon. If the eidolon is Small, it gains a +2 bonus to its Dexterity
score. It also takes a –4 penalty to its Strength and a –2 penalty to
its Constitution. It also gains a +1 size bonus to its AC and attack
rolls, a –1 penalty to its CMB and CMD scores, a +2 bonus on its
[Fly](#fly) skill checks, and a +4 bonus on its
[Stealth](#stealth) skill checks. Reduce the
damage of all of its attacks by one step (1d6 becomes 1d4, 1d4 becomes
1d3). If this choice is made, the eidolon can be made Medium whenever
the summoner can change the eidolon's evolution pool (which causes it to
lose these modifiers for being Small).

Evolutions
==========

Each eidolon receives a number of evolution points that can be spent to
give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These
abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains
a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that
the eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of a specific
level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the
eidolon additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary
are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus and add the
eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as
secondary are made using the eidolon's base attack bonus – 5 and add 1/2
the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the
eidolon only has a single natural attack, the attack is made using its
full base attack bonus and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on
damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack's type.

Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution
points cannot be saved. All of the points must be spent whenever the
summoner gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can only
be selected once.

1-Point Evolutions
------------------

The following evolutions cost 1 point from the eidolon's evolution pool.

*Bite (Ex)*: An eidolon's maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a
bite attack. This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points
of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). If the eidolon already has a bite
attack, this evolution allows it to deal 1-1/2 times its Strength
modifier on damage rolls made with its bite.

*Claws (Ex)*: An eidolon has a pair of vicious claws at the end of its
limbs, giving it two claw attacks. These attacks are primary attacks.
The claws deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The
eidolon must have the limbs evolution to take this evolution. This
evolution can only be applied to the limbs (legs) evolution once This
evolution can be selected more than once, but the eidolon must possess
an equal number of the limbs evolution.

*[Climb](#climb) (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes a
skilled climber, gaining a climb speed equal to its base speed. This
evolution can be selected more than once. Each additional time it is
selected, increase the eidolon's climb speed by 20 feet.

*Gills (Ex)*: An eidolon has gills and can breathe underwater
indefinitely.

*Improved Damage (Ex)*: One of the eidolon's natural attacks is
particularly deadly. Select one natural attack form and increase the
damage die type by one step. This evolution can be selected more than
once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects this
evolution, it applies to a different natural attack.

*[Improved Natural
Armor](#improved-natural-armor) (Ex)*:
An eidolon's hide grows thick fur, rigid scales, or bony plates, giving
it a +2 bonus to its natural armor. This evolution can be taken once for
every five levels the summoner possesses.

*Magic Attacks (Su)*: An eidolon is infused with magic, allowing it to
treat all of its natural attacks as if they were magic for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction. If the summoner is 10th level or higher,
all of the eidolon's weapons are treated as the alignment of the eidolon
for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

*[Mount](#mount) (Ex)*: An eidolon is properly
skilled and formed to serve as a combat-trained mount. The eidolon must
be at least one size category larger than its rider. This evolution is
only available to eidolons of the quadruped and serpentine base forms.

*Pincers (Ex)*: An eidolon grows a large pincers at the end of one pair
of its limbs, giving it two pincer attacks. These attacks are secondary
attacks. The pincers deal 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if
Huge). Eidolons with the grab evolution linked to pincers gain a +2
bonus on CMB checks made to grapple. The eidolon must have the limbs
(arms) evolution to take this evolution. Alternatively, the eidolon can
replace the claws from its base form with pincers (this still costs 1
evolution point). This evolution can be selected more than once, but the
eidolon must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution.

*Pounce (Ex)*: An eidolon gains quick reflexes, allowing it to make a
full attack after a charge. This evolution is only available to eidolons
of the quadruped base form.

*Pull (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the ability to pull creatures closer with
a successful attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the
eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a
free combat maneuver check. If successful, the target of the attack is
pulled 5 feet closer to the eidolon. This ability only works on
creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures
pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity. The eidolon
must have a reach of 10 feet or more to select this evolution. This
evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each
time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different
natural attack.

*Push (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the ability to push creatures away with a
successful attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the
eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a
free combat maneuver check. If successful, the target of the attack is
pushed 5 feet directly away from the eidolon. This ability only works on
creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures
pushed in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This evolution
can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an
eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural
attack.

*Reach (Ex)*: One of an eidolon's attacks is capable of striking at foes
at a distance. Pick one attack. The eidolon's reach with that attack
increases by 5 feet.

*[Resistance](#resistance) (Ex)*: An
eidolon's form takes on a resiliency to one particular energy type,
which is usually reflected in its physical body (ashen hide for fire,
icy breath for cold, and so on). Pick one energy type (acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or sonic). The eidolon gains resist 5 against that
energy type. This resistance increases by 5 for every 5 levels the
summoner possesses, to a maximum of 15 at 10th level. This evolution can
be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an
eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different energy type.

*Scent (Ex)*: An eidolon's sense of smell becomes quite acute. The
eidolon gains the [scent](#scent) special quality,
allowing it to detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the
opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it
drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can be detected at twice the normal
range. Scent does not allow the eidolon to precisely locate the
creature, only to detect its presence. It can detect the direction with
a move action. The eidolon can pinpoint the creature's location if it is
within 5 feet. The eidolon can use scent to track creatures.

*Skilled (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes especially adept at a specific skill,
gaining a +8 racial bonus on that skill. This evolution can be selected
more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects
this evolution, it applies to a different skill.

*Slam (Ex)*: An eidolon can deliver a devastating slam attack. This
attack is a primary attack. The slam deals 1d8 points of damage (2d6 if
Large, 2d8 if Huge). The eidolon must have the limbs (arms) evolution to
take this evolution. Alternatively, the eidolon can replace the claws
from its base form with this slam attack (this still costs 1 evolution
point). This evolution can be selected more than once, but the eidolon
must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution.

*Sting (Ex)*: An eidolon possesses a long, barbed stinger at the end of
its tail, granting it a sting attack. This attack is a primary attack.
The sting deals 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The
eidolon must possess the tail evolution to take this evolution. This
evolution can be selected more than once, but the eidolon must possess
an equal number of the tail evolution.

*[Swim](#swim) (Ex)*: An eidolon gains webbed
hands, feet, or powerful flippers, giving it a swim speed equal to its
base speed. This evolution does not give the eidolon the ability to
breathe underwater. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each
additional time it is selected, increase the eidolon's swim speed by 20
feet.

*Tail (Ex)*: An eidolon grows a long, powerful tail. This grants it a +2
racial bonus on [Acrobatics](#acrobatics)
checks made to balance on a surface. This evolution can be selected more
than once.

*Tail Slap (Ex)*: An eidolon can use its tail to bash nearby foes,
granting it a tail slap attack. This attack is a secondary attack. The
tail slap deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). The
eidolon must possess the tail evolution to take this evolution. This
evolution can be selected more than once, but the eidolon must possess
an equal number of the tail evolution.

*Tentacle (Ex)*: An eidolon possesses a long, sinuous tentacle, granting
it a tentacle attack. This attack is a secondary attack. The tentacle
attack deals 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). This
evolution can be selected more than once.

*Wing Buffet (Ex)*: An eidolon learns to use its wings to batter foes,
granting it two wing buffet attacks. These attacks are secondary
attacks. The wing buffets deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8
if Huge). The eidolon must possess the flight evolution, with wings, to
select this evolution.

2-Point Evolutions
------------------

The following evolutions cost 2 points from the eidolon's evolution
pool.

*Ability Increase (Ex)*: An eidolon grows larger muscles, gains faster
reflexes, achieves greater intelligence, or acquires another increase to
one of its abilities. Increase one of the eidolon's ability scores by
+2. This evolution can be selected more than once. It can only be
applied once to an individual ability score, plus 1 additional time for
every 6 levels the summoner possesses.

*Constrict (Ex)*: An eidolon gains powerful muscles that allow it to
crush those it grapples. Whenever the eidolon successfully grapples a
foe using the grab evolution, it deals additional damage equal to the
amount of damage dealt by the attack used by the grab evolution. This
evolution is only available to eidolons of the serpentine base form.

*Energy Attacks (Su)*: An eidolon's attacks become charged with energy.
Pick one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. All of the
eidolon's natural attacks deal 1d6 points of energy damage of the chosen
type on a successful hit. The summoner must be at least 5th level before
selecting this evolution.

*Flight (Ex or Su)*: An eidolon grows large wings, like those of a bat,
bird, insect, or dragon, gaining the ability to fly. The eidolon gains a
fly speed equal to its base speed. The eidolon's maneuverability depends
on it size. Medium or smaller eidolons have good maneuverability. Large
eidolons have average maneuverability, while Huge eidolons have poor
maneuverability. For 2 additional evolution points, the eidolon flies by
means of magic. It loses its wings, but its maneuverability increases to
perfect. Flying via magic means makes this a supernatural ability. The
eidolon's fly speed can be increased by spending additional evolution
points, gaining a 20-foot increase to fly speed for each additional
point spent. The summoner must be at least 5th level before selecting
this evolution.

*Gore (Ex)*: An eidolon grows a number of horns on its head, giving it a
gore attack. This attack is a primary attack. The gore deals 1d6 points
of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge).

*Grab (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes adept at grappling foes, gaining the
grab ability. Pick bite, claw, pincers, slam, tail slap, or tentacle
attacks. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected
type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If successful, the
eidolon grapples the target. This ability only works on creatures of a
size one category smaller than the eidolon or smaller. Eidolons with
this evolution receive a +4 bonus on CMB checks made to grapple.

*Immunity (Su)*: An eidolon's body becomes extremely resilient to one
energy type, gaining immunity to that type. Pick one energy type: acid,
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The eidolon gains immunity to that
energy type. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects
do not stack. Each time it applies to a different energy type. The
summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting this evolution.

*Limbs (Ex)*: An eidolon grows an additional pair of limbs. These limbs
can take one of two forms. They can be made into legs, complete with
feet. Each pair of legs increases the eidolon's base speed by 10 feet.
Alternatively, they can be made into arms, complete with hands. The
eidolon does not gain any additional natural attacks for an additional
pair of arms, but it can take other evolutions that add additional
attacks (such as claws or a slam). Arms that have hands can be used to
wield weapons, if the eidolon is proficient. This evolution can be
selected more than once.

*[Poison](#poison) (Ex)*: An eidolon secretes
toxic venom, gaining a poison attack. Pick one bite or sting attack.
Whenever the selected attack hits, the target is poisoned. **Eidolon
poison**-*type* poison (injury); *save*Fort negates; *frequency* 1/round
for 4 rounds; *effect* 1d4 Str damage; *cure*1 save. The save DC is
equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Constitution
modifier. For 2 additional evolution points, this poison deals
Constitution damage instead. This poison can be used no more than once
per round. The summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting this
evolution.

*Rake (Ex)*: An eidolon grows dangerous claws on its feet, allowing it
to make 2 rake attacks on foes it is grappling. These attacks are
primary attacks. The eidolon receives these additional attacks each time
it succeeds on a grapple check against the target. These rake attacks
deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). This evolution is
only available to eidolons of the quadruped base form. This evolution
counts as one natural attack toward te eidolon's maximum. The summoner
must be at least 4th level before selecting this evolution.

*Rend (Ex)*: An eidolon learns to rip and tear the flesh of those it
attacks with its claws, gaining the rend ability. Whenever the eidolon
makes two successful claw attacks against the same target in 1 round,
its claws latch onto the flesh and deal extra damage. This damage is
equal to the damage dealt by one claw attack plus 1-1/2 times the
eidolon's Strength modifier. The eidolon must possess the claws
evolution to select this evolution. The summoner must be at least 6th
level before selecting this evolution.

*[Trample](#trample) (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the
ability to crush its foes underfoot, gaining the trample ability. As a
full-round action, the eidolon can overrun any creature that is at least
one size smaller than itself. This works like the overrun combat
maneuver, but the eidolon does not need to make a check, it merely has
to move over opponents in its path. The creatures take 1d6 points of
damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon's
Strength modifier. Targets of the trample can make attacks of
opportunity at a –4 penalty. If a target forgoes the attack of
opportunity, it can make a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this
save is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Strength modifier. A
trampling eidolon can only deal trampling damage to a creature once per
round. This evolution is only available to eidolons of the biped or
quadruped base forms.

*Tremorsense (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes attuned to vibrations in the
ground, gaining tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet. This works like
the blindsense evolution, but only if both the eidolon and the creature
to be pinpointed are in contact with the ground. The summoner must be at
least 7th level before selecting this evolution.

*Trip (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes adept at knocking foes to the ground
with its bite, granting it a trip attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a
successful bite attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free
combat maneuver check. If successful, the target is knocked prone. If
the check fails, the eidolon is not tripped in return. This ability only
works on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the eidolon. The
eidolon must possess the bite evolution to select this evolution.

*Weapon Training (Ex)*: An eidolon learns to use a weapon, gaining
[Simple Weapon Proficiency](#simple-weapon-proficiency)
as a bonus feat. If 2 additional evolution points are spent, it gains
proficiency with all martial weapons as well.

3-Point Evolutions
------------------

The following evolutions cost 3 points from the eidolon's evolution
pool.

*Blindsense (Ex)*: An eidolon's senses become incredibly acute, giving
it blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the eidolon
to pinpoint the location of creatures that it cannot see without having
to make a [Perception](#perception) check,
but such creatures still have total concealment from the eidolon.
Visibility still affects the eidolon's movement and it is still denied
its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it
cannot see. The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting
this evolution.

*Burrow (Ex)*: An eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to
move through the earth. The eidolon gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2
its base speed. It can use this speed to move through dirt, clay, sand,
and earth. It does not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on
the surface. The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting
this evolution.

*Damage Reduction (Su)*: An eidolon's body becomes resistant to harm,
granting it damage reduction. Choose one alignment: chaotic, evil, good,
or lawful. The eidolon gains DR 5 that can be bypassed by weapons that
possess the chosen alignment. The alignment must be opposite to one of
the alignments possessed by the eidolon. At 12th level, this protection
can be increased to DR 10 by spending 2 additional evolution points. The
summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.

*Frightful Presence (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes,
gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can activate this
ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack.
Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must make a Will save or become
shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at
least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent, that opponent becomes frightened
instead. Foes with more HD than the eidolon are immune to this effect.
The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this
evolution.

*Swallow Whole (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the swallow whole ability, giving
it the ability to consume its foes. If the eidolon begins its turn with
a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab evolution), it
can attempt a combat maneuver check to swallow the creature. The
creature can be up to one size category smaller than the eidolon.
Swallowed creatures take damage equal to the eidolon's bite damage each
round plus 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. A swallowed creature keeps
the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light
slashing or piercing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is
equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The eidolon's AC against
these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a
swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability
until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can
attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has
returned to the eidolon's mouth, where it can attempt to escape or be
swallowed again. The eidolon must possess the grab evolution, tied to a
bite attack, to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 9th
level before selecting this evolution.

*[Web](#web) (Ex)*: An eidolon gains a pair of
spinnerets, giving it the ability to spin webs. The eidolon can use
these webs to support itself plus up to one creature of the same size.
It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to 8 times per day,
entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The
webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures
entangled by the web can escape with an [Escape
Artist](#escape-artist) check or a
Strength check (at a –4 penalty). The DC of these checks is equal to 10
+ 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Con modifier. The webs have a
Hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the eidolon's total
Hit Dice. The eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can
pinpoint any creature touching its webs. The eidolon must possess the
climb evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least
7th level before selecting this evolution.

4-Point Evolutions
------------------

The following evolutions cost 4 points from the eidolon's evolution
pool.

*Blindsight (Ex)*: An eidolon's senses sharpen even further, granting it
blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. The eidolon can maneuver and
attack as normal, ignoring darkness, invisibility, and most forms of
concealment as long as it has line of effect to the target. The eidolon
must possess the blindsense evolution to take this evolution. The
summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.

*Breath Weapon (Su)*: An eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of
magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select either acid, cold,
electricity, or fire. The eidolon can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot
line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the selected type per HD it
possesses. Those caught in the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save
for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the
eidolon's Constitution modifier. The eidolon can use this ability once
per day. The eidolon can use this ability 1 additional time per day by
spending an additional 1 evolution point (maximum 3/day). The summoner
must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.

*Fast Healing (Su)*: An eidolon's body gains the ability to heal wounds
very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The eidolon heals 1 point of
damage each round, just like natural healing. Fast healing does not
restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor
does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach
severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive.
This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same
plane as its summoner. This healing can be increased by 1 per round for
every 2 additional evolution points spent (maximum 5). The summoner must
be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.

*Large (Ex)*: An eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The eidolon
gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus
to its natural armor. It takes a –2 penalty to its Dexterity. This size
change also gives the creature a –1 size penalty to its AC and on attack
rolls, a +1 bonus to its CMB and CMD, a –2 penalty on
[Fly](#fly) skill checks, and a –4 penalty on
[Stealth](#stealth) skill checks. If the
eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains 10-foot reach. Any reach
evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total. The eidolon
must be Medium to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 8th
level before selecting this evolution.

If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the eidolon instead becomes
Huge. The eidolon gains a +16 bonus to Strength, a +8 bonus to
Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a –4 penalty
to its Dexterity. This size change also give the creature a –2 size
penalty to its AC and attack rolls, a +2 bonus to its CMB and CMD,
10-foot reach, a –4 penalty on [Fly](#fly) skill
checks, and a –8 penalty on
[Stealth](#stealth) skill checks. If the
eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet (10 feet
for all other base forms). Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses
are added to this total. These bonuses and penalties replace, and do not
stack with, those gained from becoming Large. The summoner must be at
least 13th level before selecting this option.

The ability increase evolution costs twice as much (4 evolution points)
when adding to the Strength or Constitution scores of a Large or Huge
eidolon.

*Spell [Resistance](#resistance) (Ex)*: An
eidolon is protected against magic, gaining spell resistance. The
eidolon's spell resistance is equal to 11 + the summoner's level. This
spell resistance does not apply to spells cast by the summoner. The
summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.

Witch

Witch
=====

Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through
blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown.
Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a
pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using
her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells,
but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in
power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain
blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what
it might be or where its true purposes lie.

**Role**: While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of
civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend
of witches' spells makes them adept at filling a number of different
roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of
abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking
greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that
guide them.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d6.

Class Features
==============

The following are the class features of the witch.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Witches are proficient with all simple
weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor
interferes with a witch's gestures, which can cause her spells with
somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list.
A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.

To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal
to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving
throw against a witch's spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch's
Intelligence modifier.

A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per
day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–10. In addition,
she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score
(see Table 1–3 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*).

A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her
spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour
communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which
spells to prepare.

**Cantrips**: Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level
spells, each day, as noted on Table 2–10 under “Spells per Day.” These
spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when
cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots,
due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.

**Hex**: Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that
grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of
her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2
levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2–10. A witch cannot
select an individual hex more than once.

Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not
provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to
10 + 1/2 the witch's level + the witch's Intelligence modifier.

*Blight (Su)*: The witch can curse an animal, plant creature, or plot of
land, causing it to wither and die. Blighting an area takes 1 round,
during which time the witch and her familiar must be in contact with the
target. If it's used on a plot of land, the land begins to wither the
following day, and over the next week all plants in the area die.
Nothing will grow in that area so long as the curse persists. A witch
can affect an area with a radius equal to her class level × 10 feet.
Blighting a creature is a standard action that requires a melee touch
attack. If used on a creature of the animal or plant type, the creature
gains the following curse: Blight Hex-*type* curse; *save*Will negates;
*frequency* 1/day; *effect* 1 Con damage. Both types of curse can be
removed with a *[remove
curse](#remove-curse)* or similar magic,
using the save DC as the DC to remove the curse. A witch can only have
one blight in effect at a time. If another blight hex is made, the first
immediately ends.

*Cackle (Su)*: A witch can cackle madly as a move action. Any creature
that is within 30 feet that is under the effects of an agony hex, charm
hex, evil eye hex, fortune hex, or misfortune hex caused by the witch
has the duration of that hex extended by 1 round.

*Cauldron (Ex)*: The witch receives [Brew
Potion](#brew-potion) as a bonus feat and a +4 insight
bonus on [Craft](#craft) (alchemy) skill checks.

*Charm (Su)*: A witch can charm an animal or humanoid creature within 30
feet by beckoning and speaking soothing words. This improves the
attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the witch
had successfully used the
[Diplomacy](#diplomacy) skill. The effect
lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Witch's Intelligence modifier.
A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful,
a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th
level, this effect improves the attitude of the target creature by 2
steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.

*Coven (Ex)*: The witch counts as a hag for the purpose of joining a
hag's coven. The coven must contain at least one hag. In addition,
whenever the witch with this hex is within 30 feet of another witch with
this hex, she can use the aid another action to grant a +1 bonus to the
other witch's caster level for 1 round. This bonus applies to the
witch's spells and all of her hexes.

*Disguise (Su)*: A witch can change her appearance for a number of hours
equal to her class level, as if using *[disguise
self](#disguise-self)*. These hours do
not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Evil Eye (Su)*: The witch can cause doubt to creep into the mind of a
foe within 30 feet that she can see. The target takes a –2 penalty on
one of the following (witch's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls,
saving throws, or skill checks. This hex lasts for a number of rounds
equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save reduces this
to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. At 8th level the
penalty increases to –4.

*Flight (Su)*: The witch grows lighter as she gains power, eventually
gaining the ability to fly. At 1st level, the witch can use *[feather
fall](#feather-fall)* at will and gains a
+4 racial bonus on [Swim](#swim) checks. At 3rd
level, she can cast *[levitate](#levitate)*
once per day. At 5th level, she can fly, as per the spell, for a number
of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be
consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. This hex
only affects the witch.

*Fortune (Su)*: The witch can grant a creature within 30 feet a bit of
good luck for 1 round. The target can call upon this good luck once per
round, allowing him to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving
throw, or skill check, taking the better result. He must decide to use
this ability before the first roll is made. At 8th level and 16th level,
the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. Once a creature has
benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24
hours.

*Healing (Su)*: A witch can soothe the wounds of those she touches. This
acts as a *[cure light
wounds](#cure-light-wounds)* spell,
using the witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the
healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th level,
this hex acts like *[cure moderate
wounds](#cure-moderate-wounds)*.

*Misfortune (Su)*: The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to
suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an
ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll
twice and take the worse result. A Will save negates this hex. At 8th
level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round.
This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts. Whether
or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this
hex again for 1 day.

*Slumber (Su):* A witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to fall into
a deep, magical sleep, as per the spell
*[sleep](#sleep)*. The creature receives a Will
save to negate the effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep
for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. This hex can affect a
creature of any HD. The creature will not wake due to noise or light,
but others can rouse it with a standard action. This hex ends
immediately if the creature takes damage. Whether or not the save is
successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.

*Tongues (Su)*: A witch with this hex can understand any spoken language
for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as *[comprehend
languages](#comprehend-languages).*This
duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in
1-minute increments. At 5th level, a witch can use this ability to speak
any language, as per *[tongues](#tongues)*.

*Ward (Su)*: A witch can use this hex to place a protective ward over
one creature. The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC
and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This ward lasts until the
warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A witch knows when a
warded creature is no longer protected. A witch can have only one ward
active at a time. If the witch uses this ability again, the previous
ward immediately ends. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. At
8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by
+1.

**Witch's Familiar (Ex)**: At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with
a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her
along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill
bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This
functions like the wizard's arcane bond class feature, except as noted
in the Witch's Familiar section.

A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells.
Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot
prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch's familiar
begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level
spells of the witch's choice. The witch also selects a number of
additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store
in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any
spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level)
to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar
through a special ritual (see sidebar).

**Major Hex**: Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter,
a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could
select a new hex.

*Agony (Su)*: With a quick incantation, a witch can place this hex on
one creature within 60 feet, causing them to suffer intense pain. The
target is nauseated for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. A
Fortitude save negates this effect. If the saving throw is failed, the
target can attempt a new save each round to end the effect. Whether or
not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex
again for 1 day.

*Hag's Eye (Su)*: A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor that
she can see through. This functions as per the spell *[arcane
eye](#arcane-eye)*. If the witch has the
coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet who also have the coven hex
can see through this sensor as well, although the witch that created it
still controls it. The witch can use this eye for a number of minutes
per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive,
but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.

*Major Healing (Su)*: By calling upon eerie powers, the witch's touch
can mend even the most terrible wounds of those she touches. This acts
as *[cure serious
wounds](#cure-serious-wounds)*,
using the witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the
major healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 15th
level, this hex acts like *[cure critical
wounds](#cure-critical-wounds)*.

*Nightmares (Su)*: Calling upon fell powers, a witch can place a hex on
a creature within 60 feet that causes its sleep to be tormented by
terrible nightmares. This functions as the spell
*[nightmare](#nightmare)* each time the
affected creature attempts to rest. A Will save negates this effect. If
the save is failed, the target must make a new save each night or be
unable to rest.

*Retribution (Su)*: A witch can place a retribution hex on a creature
within 60 feet, causing terrible wounds to open across the target's
flesh whenever it deals damage to another creature in melee. Immediately
after the hexed creature deals damage in melee, it takes half that
damage (round down). This damage bypasses any resistances, immunities,
or damage reduction the creature possesses. This effect lasts for a
number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save
negates this effect.

*Vision (Su)*: A witch with the vision hex can grant a glimpse of the
future to a creature touched. Granting a vision takes 1 minute, during
which time the witch and the target must remain in contact with one
another. At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of
the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision,
subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the
future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted
toward the alignment of the witch that granted them. For example, the
visions granted by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and
destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous
events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to another vision
until the current vision has either come to pass or been prevented. A
witch cannot use this ability on herself. Unwilling creatures receive a
Will save to negate the vision.

*Waxen Image (Su)*: The witch can spend a full-round action to create a
crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can see within 30
feet. Once the image is complete, the subject must make a Will save. If
the subject fails, the witch gains a small measure of control over the
creature. Whenever she exercises this control, the creature receives a
new Will save to end the effect. This effect occurs on the witch's turn
and does not impede the creature's actions on its turn. The witch can
use the waxen image a number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier
before it melts. As a standard action, the witch can cause the subject
to do any one of the following things: move up to the creature's speed
in any direction, attack itself once with any weapon in hand (this
attack automatically hits), lay down on the ground, or drop anything
held. Alternatively, she can spend one of her uses to simply torture the
image, causing the creature to be both sickened and staggered on its
turn. As soon as the creature has succeeded on a saving throw against
this effect, it is immune to it for 24 hours. The is an enchantment
(compulsion) effect.

*Weather Control (Su)*: A witch with this hex can use *[control
weather](#control-weather)* once per
day, but creating the weather takes 1 full hour of chanting, dancing,
and communing with her familiar.

**Grand Hex**: Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter,
a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could
select a new hex.

*Death Curse (Su)*: This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart, causing
death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The
hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If this save
is failed, the creature becomes fatigued the first round of the hex. On
the second round of the hex, the creature becomes exhausted. On the
third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort save.
Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second remain
exhausted and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of
the witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect,
but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves are
successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.

*Eternal Slumber (Su)*: The witch can touch a creature, causing it to
drift off into a permanent slumber. The creature receives a Will save to
negate this effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep and
cannot be woken. The effect can only be removed with a
*[wish](#wish)* or similar magic, although
slaying the witch ends the effect. The witch can use this ability to
poison food or drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall
into an eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at
any one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not consumed.
Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target
of this hex again for 1 day.

*Forced Reincarnation (Su)*: The witch causes a creature within 30 feet
to die and be immediately *reincarnated* into a new body. A Will save
negates this effect. Those that fail are slain and immediately brought
back to life with the spell
*[reincarnate](#reincarnate)*. Whether or
not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex
again for 1 day.

*Life Giver (Su)*: Once per day the witch can, as a full round action,
touch a dead creature and bring it back to life. This functions as
*[resurrection](#resurrection)*, but it
does not require a material component.

*Natural Disaster (Su)*: A witch using this hex calls down the forces of
nature to wreak havoc on an area. This functions as a *[storm of
vengeance](#storm-of-vengeance)*combined
with an *[earthquake](#earthquake)* that
occurs on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the
sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If
disrupted, the effect immediately ends. A witch can only use this
ability once per day.

Witch's Familiar
================

  Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch's spell list.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **[Spells](#spells) Gained at a New Level**: A [witch's familiar](#witch's-familiar) learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two [spells](#spells) from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free [spells](#spells) must be of spell levels she can cast.
  **Familiar Teaching Familiar**: A [witch's familiar](#witch's-familiar) can learn [spells](#spells) from another [witch's familiar](#witch's-familiar). To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a [Spellcraft](#spellcraft). Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of [spells](#spells) for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its [spells](#spells) to another, subject to GM discretion.
  **Learn from a Scroll**: A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a [Spellcraft](#spellcraft) check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.

  : Adding Spells to a Witch's Familiar

By forging strange bonds with unnameable beings, witches gain the
service of a mystical advisor, a familiar to both serve her and reveal
to her secrets unknown to most mortals. A familiar is an animal chosen
by a witch to aid her in her spellcasting and grant her special powers.
This uses the same rules as the wizard's [arcane
bond](#arcane-bond) class feature, except as
noted below. A witch uses her level as her effective wizard level when
determining the abilities of her familiar. A witch can choose any of the
familiars available to a wizard in addition to the new familiars
presented here.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the
purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the witch's
level. If a witch possesses such levels, her familiar always uses the
witch rules for familiars, not those provided by other classes, such as
wizards or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline. A witch's familiar only
stores witch spells. All other spells are stored normally, as noted in
their class features.

If a familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 day later through a
special ritual that costs 500 gp per witch level. The ritual takes 8
hours to complete. A new familiar begins knowing all of the 0-level
spells plus two spells of every level the witch is able to cast. These
are in addition to any bonus spells known by the familiar based on the
witch's level and her patron (see patron spells).

*Store Spells*: Starting at 1st level, a witch's familiar stores all of
the spells that the witch knows. This does not allow the familiar to
cast these spells or use spell-trigger or spell completion magic items.
Starting at 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch's
familiar adds new bonus spells to the witch's spell list based on her
patron. These spells are automatically stored by the familiar and can be
prepared as normal once they are gained.

*Deliver Touch Spells (Su)*: If a witch is 3rd level or higher, her
familiar can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the witch and the
familiar are in contact at the time the witch casts a touch spell, she
can designate her familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then
deliver the touch spell just as the witch would. As usual, if the witch
casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell
dissipates. If the witch activates a hex, her familiar can be used to
make the touch. She does not have to be in contact with the familiar to
use this ability.

New Familiars
=============

In addition to the familiars presented in the *Pathfinder RPG Core
Rulebook*, witches might select any of the following animals as their
familiar. Sorcerers and wizards might also adopt these new familiars,
utilizing the same rules as for any other familiar.

These familiars make use these statistics: the [house
centipede](), [king
crab](#crab-giant), [greensting
scorpion](/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/magic/newFamiliars.html#greensting-scorpion-cr-1/4),
fox ([dog](#dog) with the [young
template](#young-creature)),
octopus ([octopus](#octopus) with the [young
template](#young-creature)), and
[scarlet spider](#spider-giant).

  Familiar    Special Ability
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Centipede   Master gains a +3 bonus on [Stealth](#stealth) checks
  Crab        Master gains a +2 bonus on grapple checks
  Fox         Master gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves
  Octopus     Master gains a +3 bonus on [Swim](#swim) checks
  Scorpion    Master gains a +2 bonus on initiative rolls
  Spider      Master gains a +3 bonus on [Climb](#climb) checks

Patron Spells
=============

At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a
patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch
power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these
forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the
following forces. At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a
witch's patron adds new spells to a witch's list of spells known. These
spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the
familiar. Spells marked with an asterisk (\*) appear in Chapter 5 of
this book. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron
is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to
decide.
