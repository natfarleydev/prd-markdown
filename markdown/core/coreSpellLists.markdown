# Spell Lists {#Spell-Lists}

An ^M^ or ^F^ appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell
lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component,
respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component
pouch.

**Order of Presentation**: In the spell lists and the short
descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in
alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain
spell chains. When a spell's name begins with “lesser,”
“greater,” or “mass,” the spell is alphabetized under the second
word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice**: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with
“character levels” for effects that affect a specific number of
Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their
race, not from classes, still have character levels equal to
their Hit Dice.

**Caster Level**: A spell's power often depends on caster level,
which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of
casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a
caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified.
The word “level” in the short descriptions that follow always
refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters**: The words “creature” and
“character” are used synonymously in the short descriptions.
